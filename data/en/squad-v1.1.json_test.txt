1 Following their loss in the divisional round of the previous seasons playoffs the Denver Broncos underwent numerous coaching changes including a mutual parting with head coach John Fox who had won four divisional championships in his four years as Broncos head coach and the hiring of Gary Kubiak as the new head coach.
2 Under Kubiak the Broncos planned to install a runoriented offense with zone blocking to blend in with quarterback Peyton Mannings shotgun passing skills but struggled with numerous changes and injuries to the offensive line as well as Manning having his worst statistical season since his rookie year with the Indianapolis Colts in 1998 due to a plantar fasciitis injury in his heel that he had suffered since the summer and the simple fact that Manning was getting old as he turned 39 in the 2015 offseason.
3 Although the team had a 7–0 start Manning led the NFL in interceptions.
4 In week 10 Manning suffered a partial tear of the plantar fasciitis in his left foot.
5 He set the NFLs alltime record for career passing yards in this game but was benched after throwing four interceptions in favor of backup quarterback Brock Osweiler who took over as the starter for most of the remainder of the regular season.
6 Osweiler was injured however leading to Mannings return during the Week 17 regular season finale where the Broncos were losing 13–7 against the 4–11 San Diego Chargers resulting in Manning reclaiming the starting quarterback position for the playoffs by leading the team to a key 27–20 win that enabled the team to clinch the number one overall AFC seed.
7 Under defensive coordinator Wade Phillips the Broncos defense ranked number one in total yards allowed passing yards allowed and sacks and like the previous three seasons the team has continued to set numerous individual league and franchise records.
8 With the defense carrying the team despite the issues with the offense the Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record and earned homefield advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.

4 The Duchy of Normandy which they formed by treaty with the French crown was a great fief of medieval France and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure.
5 The Normans are noted both for their culture such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traditions and for their significant military accomplishments and innovations.
6 Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines and an expedition on behalf of their duke William the Conqueror led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.
7 Norman cultural and military influence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antioch in the Levant to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain to Ireland and to the coasts of north Africa and the Canary Islands.

2 The Duchy of Normandy which began in 911 as a fiefdom was established by the treaty of SaintClairsurEpte between King Charles III of West Francia and the famed Viking ruler Rollo and was situated in the former Frankish kingdom of Neustria.
3 The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions.
4 The area corresponded to the northern part of presentday Upper Normandy down to the river Seine but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine.

2 The Hauteville family achieved princely rank by proclaiming prince Guaimar IV of Salerno Duke of Apulia and Calabria.
3 He promptly awarded their elected leader William Iron Arm with the title of count in his capital of Melfi.

7 Immediately before the battle the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city.
8 Forced to retreat Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium.
9 The citys garrison resisted until February 1082 when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there.
10 The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica.

1 In the visual arts the Normans did not have the rich and distinctive traditions of the cultures they conquered.
2 However in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform encouraging the Cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts.
3 The church was utilised by the dukes as a unifying force for their disparate duchy.
4 The chief monasteries taking part in this renaissance of Norman art and scholarship were MontSaintMichel Fécamp Jumièges Bec SaintOuen SaintEvroul and SaintWandrille.
5 These centres were in contact with the socalled Winchester school which channeled a pure Carolingian artistic tradition to Normandy.
6 In the final decade of the 11th and first of the 12th century Normandy experienced a golden age of illustrated manuscripts but it was brief and the major scriptoria of Normandy ceased to function after the midpoint of the century.
7 When did the church reform begin?	early 11th century	2

1 In Britain Norman art primarily survives as stonework or metalwork such as capitals and baptismal fonts.
2 In southern Italy however Norman artwork survives plentifully in forms strongly influenced by its Greek Lombard and Arab forebears.
3 Of the royal regalia preserved in Palermo the crown is Byzantine in style and the coronation cloak is of Arab craftsmanship with Arabic inscriptions.
4 Many churches preserve sculptured fonts capitals and more importantly mosaics which were common in Norman Italy and drew heavily on the Greek heritage.
5 Lombard Salerno was a centre of ivorywork in the 11th century and this continued under Norman domination.
6 Finally should be noted the intercourse between French Crusaders traveling to the Holy Land who brought with them French artefacts with which to gift the churches at which they stopped in southern Italy amongst their Norman cousins.
7 For this reason many south Italian churches preserve works from France alongside their native pieces.
8 What is the most important type of Norman art preserved in churches?	mosaics	4

1 One of the things Tesla developed at that laboratory in 1887 was an induction motor that ran on alternating current a power system format that was starting to be built in Europe and the United States because of its advantages in longdistance highvoltage transmission.
2 The motor used polyphase current which generated a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor a principle Tesla claimed to have conceived in 1882.

1 Teslas demonstration of his induction motor and Westinghouses subsequent licensing of the patent both in 1888 put Tesla firmly on the AC side of the socalled War of Currents an electrical distribution battle being waged between Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse that had been simmering since Westinghouses first AC system in 1886 and had reached the point of allout warfare by 1888.
2 This started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with Edison holding all the patents for DC and the incandescent light and Westinghouse using his own patented AC system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the Edison patent.
3 The acquisition of a feasible AC motor gave Westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated AC system but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of Teslas motor had to be put on hold for a while.
4 The competition resulted in Edison Machine Works pursuing AC development in 1890 and by 1892 Thomas Edison was no longer in control of his own company which was consolidated into the conglomerate General Electric and converting to an AC delivery system at that point.

2 Over several years there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to utilize power generated by the falls with many systems being proposed by several US and European companies including twophase and threephase AC highvoltage DC and even compressed air.
3 Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems.
4 Tesla advised Adams that a twophased system would be the most reliable and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using twophase alternating current.
5 Based on Teslas advice and Westinghouses demonstration that they could build a complete AC system at the Columbian Exposition a contract for building a twophase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls was awarded to Westinghouse Electric.

1 The mid 1890s saw the conglomerate General Electric backed by financier J P Morgan involved in takeover attempts and patent battles with Westinghouse Electric.
2 Although a patentsharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 Westinghouse was still cashstrapped from the financial warfare.
3 To secure further loans Westinghouse was forced to revisit Teslas AC patent which bankers considered a financial strain on the company at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated 200000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla Brown and Peck.
4 In 1897 Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to deal with the bankers to try to collect future royalties.
5 Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Teslas AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of 216000 this provided Westinghouse a break from what due to alternating currents rapid gain in popularity had turned out to be an overly generous 250 per AC horsepower royalty.

1 In 1900 Tesla was granted patents for a system of transmitting electrical energy and an electrical transmitter.
2 When Guglielmo Marconi made his famous firstever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901 Tesla quipped that it was done with 17 Tesla patents though there is little to support this claim.
3 This was the beginning of years of patent battles over radio with Teslas patents being upheld in 1903 followed by a reverse decision in favor of Marconi in 1904.
4 In 1943 a Supreme Court of the United States decision restored the prior patents of Tesla Oliver Lodge and John Stone.
5 The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconis claim as the first to achieve radio transmission just that since Marconis claim to certain patents were questionable he could not claim infringement on those same patents there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the US government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Teslas prior patent.

1 In the August 1917 edition of the magazine Electrical Experimenter Tesla postulated that electricity could be used to locate submarines via using the reflection of an electric ray of tremendous frequency with the signal being viewed on a fluorescent screen a system that has been noted to have a superficial resemblance to modern radar.
2 Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water but Émile Girardeau who helped develop Frances first radar system in the 1930s noted in 1953 that Teslas general speculation that a very strong high frequency signal would be needed was correct stating Tesla was prophesying or dreaming since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out but one must add that if he was dreaming at least he was dreaming correctly.

4 By what main attribute are computational problems classified utilizing computational complexity theory?	inherent difficulty	1
5 What is the term for a task that generally lends itself to being solved by a computer?	computational problems	1
1 A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources whatever the algorithm used.
2 The theory formalizes this intuition by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them such as time and storage.
3 Other complexity measures are also used such as the amount of communication used in communication complexity the number of gates in a circuit used in circuit complexity and the number of processors used in parallel computing.
4 One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do.

1 Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory.
2 A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem.
3 More precisely it tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources.
4 In turn imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory the latter theory asks what kind of problems can in principle be solved algorithmically.
5 What two fields of theoretical computer science closely mirror computational complexity theory?	analysis of algorithms and computability theory	1
6 What field of computer science analyzes the resource requirements of a specific algorithm isolated unto itself within a given problem?	analysis of algorithms	1
7 What field of computer science analyzes all possible algorithms in aggregate to determine the resource requirements needed to solve to a given problem?	computational complexity theory	2
8 What field of computer science is primarily concerned with determining the likelihood of whether or not a problem can ultimately be solved using algorithms?	computability theory	1
1 A computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a solution for every instance.
2 The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance and should not be confused with the problem itself.
3 In computational complexity theory a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved.
4 In contrast an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance which can serve as the input for a decision problem.
5 For example consider the problem of primality testing.
6 The instance is a number eg.
7 15 and the solution is yes if the number is prime and no otherwise in this case no.
8 Stated another way the instance is a particular input to the problem and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input.
9 What is the name given to the input string of a computational problem?	problem instance	2
10 In computational complexity theory what is the term given to describe the baseline abstract question needing to be solved?	the problem	2
11 Is a problem instance typically characterized as abstract or concrete?	concrete	4
12 What is another name for any given measure of input associated with a problem?	instances	1
13 What is the general term used to describe the output to any given input in a problem instance?	solution	1
1 To further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germanys 15 largest cities.
2 The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem such as asking for a round trip through all sites in Milan whose total length is at most 10 km.
3 For this reason complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.
4 By how many kilometers does the traveling salesman problem seek to classify a route between the 15 largest cities in Germany?	2000	1
5 What is one example of an instance that the quantitative answer to the traveling salesman problem fails to answer?	round trip through all sites in Milan	2
6 What does computational complexity theory most specifically seek to answer?	computational problems	3
1 When considering computational problems a problem instance is a string over an alphabet.
2 Usually the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet ie the set 01 and thus the strings are bitstrings.
3 As in a realworld computer mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded.
4 For example integers can be represented in binary notation and graphs can be encoded directly via their adjacency matrices or by encoding their adjacency lists in binary.
5 In a computational problem what can be described as a string over an alphabet?	problem instance	1
6 What is the name of the alphabet is most commonly used in a problem instance?	binary alphabet	2
7 What is another term for the string of a problem instance?	bitstrings	2

9 What is one way in which graphs can be encoded?	adjacency matrices	4
1 Decision problems are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory.
2 A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either yes or no or alternately either 1 or 0.
3 A decision problem can be viewed as a formal language where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes and the nonmembers are those instances whose output is no.
4 The objective is to decide with the aid of an algorithm whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration.
5 If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer yes the algorithm is said to accept the input string otherwise it is said to reject the input.
6 What kind of problems are one of the main topics studied in computational complexity theory?	Decision problems	1
7 What are the two simple word responses to a decision problem?	yes or no	2

9 What will the output be for a member of the language of a decision problem?	yes	2
10 What answer denotes that an algorithm has accepted an input string?	yes	2
1 An example of a decision problem is the following.
2 The input is an arbitrary graph.
3 The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is connected or not.
4 The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs—of course to obtain a precise definition of this language one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings.
5 What kind of graph is an example of an input used in a decision problem?	arbitrary graph	2
6 What is the term for the set of all connected graphs related to this decision problem?	formal language	4
7 What encoding decision needs to be made in order to determine an exact definition of the formal language?	how graphs are encoded as binary strings	4
1 A function problem is a computational problem where a single output of a total function is expected for every input but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem that is it isnt just yes or no.
2 Notable examples include the traveling salesman problem and the integer factorization problem.
3 A function problem is an example of what?	a computational problem	1

6 In addition to the traveling salesman problem what is another example of a function problem?	the integer factorization problem	2
7 Is the output of a functional problem typically characterized by a simple or complex answer?	complex	1
1 It is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems.
2 However this is not really the case since function problems can be recast as decision problems.
3 For example the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples a b c such that the relation a × b  c holds.
4 Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.
5 How can function problems typically be restated?	decision problems	1
6 If two integers are multiplied and output a value what is this expression set called?	set of triples	3
1 To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem.
2 However the running time may in general depend on the instance.
3 In particular larger instances will require more time to solve.
4 Thus the time required to solve a problem or the space required or any measure of complexity is calculated as a function of the size of the instance.
5 This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits.
6 Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size.
7 For instance in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2n vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with n vertices.
8 What is a commonly used measurement used to determine the complexity of a computational problem?	how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem	1
9 What is one variable on which the running time may be contingent?	the instance	2
10 How is the time needed to obtain the solution to a problem calculated?	as a function of the size of the instance	4
11 In what unit is the size of the input measured?	bits	5
12 Complexity theory seeks to define the relationship between the scale of algorithms with respect to what other variable?	an increase in the input size	6
1 If the input size is n the time taken can be expressed as a function of n Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different the worstcase time complexity Tn is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n If Tn is a polynomial in n then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm.
2 Cobhams thesis says that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm.
3 Whose thesis states that the solution to a problem is solvable with reasonable resources assuming it allows for a polynomial time algorithm?	Cobhams thesis	2
4 If input size is is equal to n what can respectively be assumed is the function of n?	the time taken	1
5 What term corresponds to the maximum measurement of time across all functions of n?	worstcase time complexity	1
6 How is worstcase time complexity written as an expression?	Tn	1
7 Assuming that T represents a polynomial in Tn what is the term given to the corresponding algorithm?	polynomial time algorithm	1
1 A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine.
2 It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape.
3 Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology but rather as a thought experiment representing a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper.
4 It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem.
5 Indeed this is the statement of the Church–Turing thesis.
6 Furthermore it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today such as a RAM machine Conways Game of Life cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine.
7 Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.
8 What is the term for a mathematical model that theoretically represents a general computing machine?	A Turing machine	1
9 It is generally assumed that a Turing machine can solve anything capable of also being solved using what?	an algorithm	4
10 What is the most commonplace model utilized in complexity theory?	the Turing machine	7
11 What does a Turing machine handle on a strip of tape?	symbols	2
1 A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions.
2 A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits.
3 The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently.
4 Algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms.
5 A nondeterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of nondeterminism which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state.
6 One way to view nondeterminism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step and if it solves the problem in any of these branches it is said to have solved the problem.
7 Clearly this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes.
8 For examples see nondeterministic algorithm.
9 What is generally considered to be the most basic iteration of a Turing machine?	A deterministic Turing machine	1
10 What fixed set of factors determine the actions of a deterministic Turing machine	rules 	1.
11 What is the term used to identify a deterministic Turing machine that has additional random bits?	A probabilistic Turing machine	2
12 What type of Turing machine is capable of multiple actions and extends into a variety of computational paths?	A nondeterministic Turing machine	5
13 What is the term given to algorithms that utilize random bits?	randomized algorithms	4
1 Many types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes such as deterministic Turing machines probabilistic Turing machines nondeterministic Turing machines quantum Turing machines symmetric Turing machines and alternating Turing machines.
2 They are all equally powerful in principle but when resources such as time or space are bounded some of these may be more powerful than others.
3 Turing machines are commonly employed to define what?	complexity classes	1
4 What are two factors that directly effect how powerful a Turing machine may or may not be?	time or space	2
5 In the determination of complexity classes what are two examples of types of Turing machines?	probabilistic Turing machines  nondeterministic Turing machines	1
1 Many machine models different from the standard multitape Turing machines have been proposed in the literature for example random access machines.
2 Perhaps surprisingly each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power.
3 The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary.
4 What all these models have in common is that the machines operate deterministically.
5 What is an example of a machine model that deviates from a generally accepted multitape Turing machine?	random access machines	1
6 In considering Turing machines and alternate variables what measurement left unaffected by conversion between machine models?	computational power	2
7 What two resources commonly consumed by alternate models are typically known to vary?	time and memory	3
8 What commonality do alternate machine models such as random access machines share with Turing machines?	the machines operate deterministically	4
1 However some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources.
2 For example a nondeterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once.
3 The nondeterministic Turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze so that nondeterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems.
4 What type of Turing machine can be characterized by checking multiple possibilities at the same time?	nondeterministic	2
5 What often affects or facilitates ease of analysis in computational problems?	unusual resources	1
6 A nondeterministic Turing machine has the ability to capture what facet of useful analysis?	mathematical models	3
7 What is the most critical resource in the analysis of computational problems associated with nondeterministic Turing machines?	time	3
1 For a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space a computational model such as the deterministic Turing machine is used.
2 The time required by a deterministic Turing machine M on input x is the total number of state transitions or steps the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer yes or no.
3 A Turing machine M is said to operate within time fn if the time required by M on each input of length n is at most fn.
4 A decision problem A can be solved in time fn if there exists a Turing machine operating in time fn that solves the problem.
5 Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty one defines sets of problems based on some criteria.
6 For instance the set of problems solvable within time fn on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIMEfn.
7 The time required to output an answer on a deterministic Turing machine is expressed as what?	state transitions	2
8 Complexity theory classifies problems based on what primary attribute?	difficulty	5
9 What is the expression used to identify any given series of problems capable of being solved within time on a deterministic Turing machine?	DTIMEfn	6
10 What is the most critical resource measured to in assessing the determination of a Turing machines ability to solve any given set of problems?	time	1
1 Analogous definitions can be made for space requirements.
2 Although time and space are the most wellknown complexity resources any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource.
3 Complexity measures are very generally defined by the Blum complexity axioms.
4 Other complexity measures used in complexity theory include communication complexity circuit complexity and decision tree complexity.
5 Time and space are both examples of what type of resource?	complexity resources	2
6 A complexity resource can also be described as what other type of resource?	computational resource	2
7 What is typically used to broadly define complexity measures?	Blum complexity axioms	3
8 Communication complexity is an example of what type of measure?	Complexity measures	3
9 Decision tree is an example of what type of measure?	Complexity measures	3
1 The best worst and average case complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity or any other complexity measure of different inputs of the same size.
2 Since some inputs of size n may be faster to solve than others we define the following complexities.
3 What are the three primary expressions used to represent case complexity?	best  worst and average	1
4 Case complexity likelihoods provide variable probabilities of what general measure?	complexity measure	1
5 What is one common example of a critical complexity measure?	time	1
6 Case complexities provide three likelihoods of what differing variable that remains the same size?	inputs	1
1 For example consider the deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort.
2 This solves the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input.
3 The worstcase is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order and the algorithm takes time On2 for this case.
4 If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely the average time taken for sorting is On log n.
5 The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half also needing On log n time.
6 What provides a solution to a list of integers provided as input that ned to be sorted?	deterministic sorting algorithm quicksort	1
7 When extensive time is required to sort integers this represents what case complexity?	worstcase	3
8 What is the expression used to denote a worst case complexity as expressed by time taken?	On2	3
1 To classify the computation time or similar resources such as space consumption one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem.
2 The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worstcase complexity unless specified otherwise.
3 Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms.
4 To show an upper bound Tn on the time complexity of a problem one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most Tn.
5 However proving lower bounds is much more difficult since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem.
6 The phrase all possible algorithms includes not just the algorithms known today but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future.
7 To show a lower bound of Tn for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than Tn.
8 Classification of resources is contingent on determining the upper and lower bounds of minimum time required by what?	the most efficient algorithm	1
9 The analysis of a specific algorithm is typically assigned to what field of computational science?	analysis of algorithms	3
10 Which bound of time is more difficult to establish?	lower bounds	1
11 A specific algorithm demonstrating Tn represents what measure of time complexity?	upper bound	4
12 What is the colloquial phrase used to convey the continuum of algorithms with unlimited availability irrespective of time?	all possible algorithms	5
1 Upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big O notation which hides constant factors and smaller terms.
2 This makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used.
3 For instance if Tn  7n2  15n  40 in big O notation one would write Tn  On2.
4 What expression is generally used to convey upper or lower bounds?	big O notation	1
5 What does a big O notation hide?	constant factors and smaller terms	1
6 How would one write Tn  7n2  15n  40 in big O notation?	Tn  On2	3
7 Big O notation provides autonomy to upper and lower bounds with relationship to what?	the computational model	2
1 Of course some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework.
2 Thus a typical complexity class has a definition like the following.
3 What has complicated definitions that prevent classification into a framework?	complexity classes	1
4 Complexity classes are generally classified into what?	framework	1
5 Difficulty in establishing a framework for complexity classes can be caused by what variable?	complicated definitions	1
1 But bounding the computation time above by some concrete function fn often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model.
2 For instance the language xx  x is any binary string can be solved in linear time on a multitape Turing machine but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of singletape Turing machines.
3 If we allow polynomial variations in running time CobhamEdmonds thesis states that the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related Goldreich 2008 Chapter 12.
4 This forms the basis for the complexity class P which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time.
5 The corresponding set of function problems is FP.
6 Concrete bounding of computation time frequently produces complexity classes contingent upon what?	chosen machine model	1
7 A multitape Turing machine requires what type of time for a solution?	linear time	2
8 A language solved in quadratic time implies the use of what type of Turing machine?	singletape Turing machines	2
9 What thesis specifies that a polynomial relationship exists within time complexities in a computational model?	CobhamEdmonds thesis	3
10 Decision problems capable of being solved by a deterministic Turing machine while maintaining adherence to polynomial time belong to what class?	complexity class P	4
1 Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm.
2 Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following.
3 What are two examples of measurements are bound within algorithms to establish complexity classes?	time or space	1
4 What function is used by algorithms to define measurements like time or space?	bounding	1
5 Bounding of time and space or similar measurements is often used by algorithms to define what?	complexity classes	1
1 Other important complexity classes include BPP ZPP and RP which are defined using probabilistic Turing machines AC and NC which are defined using Boolean circuits and BQP and QMA which are defined using quantum Turing machines.
2 P is an important complexity class of counting problems not decision problems.
3 Classes like IP and AM are defined using Interactive proof systems.
4 ALL is the class of all decision problems.
5 What are three examples of complexity classes associated with definitions established by probabilistic Turing machines?	BPP  ZPP and RP	1
6 AC and NC are complexity classes typically associated with what type of circuit?	Boolean	1
7 BQP and QMA are examples of complexity classes most commonly associated with what type of Turing machine?	quantum	1
8 What is the expression used to represent a complexity class of counting problems?	P	2
9 IP and AM are most commonly defined by what type of proof system?	Interactive	3
1 For the complexity classes defined in this way it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on say computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems.
2 In particular although DTIMEn is contained in DTIMEn2 it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict.
3 For time and space requirements the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively.
4 They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources.
5 Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other.
6 Having deduced such proper set inclusions we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.
7 What is an example of a measurement within a complexity class that would create a bigger set of problems if the bounds were relaxed?	computation time	1
8 In what expression can one expect to find DTIMEn	DTIMEn2 	2.
9 What theorems are responsible for determining questions of time and space requirements?	time and space hierarchy theorems	3
10 Resources are constrained by hierarchy theorems to produce what?	a proper hierarchy on the classes defined	4
11 What kind of statement is made in the effort of establishing the time and space requirements needed to enhance the ultimate number of problems solved?	quantitative statements	6
1 The time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes.
2 For instance the time hierarchy theorem tells us that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that L is strictly contained in PSPACE.
3 What is the foundation for separation results within complexity classes?	time and space hierarchy theorems	1
4 What is responsible for constraining P according to the time hierarchy theorem?	EXPTIME	2
5 Within what variable is L constrained according to the space hierarchy theorem?	PSPACE	2
1 Many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction.
2 A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem.
3 It captures the informal notion of a problem being at least as difficult as another problem.
4 For instance if a problem X can be solved using an algorithm for Y X is no more difficult than Y and we say that X reduces to Y.
5 There are many different types of reductions based on the method of reduction such as Cook reductions Karp reductions and Levin reductions and the bound on the complexity of reductions such as polynomialtime reductions or logspace reductions.
6 What concept is frequently used to define complexity classes?	reduction	1
7 Reduction essentially takes one problem and converts into what?	another problem	2
8 According to reduction if X and Y can be solved by the same algorithm then X performs what function in relationship to Y?	reduces	4
9 What are two examples of different types of reduction?	Karp reductions and Levin reductions	5
10 Polynomial time reductions are an example of what?	the bound on the complexity of reductions	5
1 The most commonly used reduction is a polynomialtime reduction.
2 This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time.
3 For example the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers.
4 This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer.
5 Indeed this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm.
6 Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.
7 What is the most frequently employed type of reduction?	polynomialtime reduction	1
8 What equates to a squared integer according to polynomial time reduction?	multiplying two integers	3
9 What measurement of time is used in polynomial time reduction?	polynomial time	2
10 What would need to remain constant in a multiplication algorithm to produce the same outcome whether multiplying or squaring two integers?	input	5
11 According to polynomial time reduction squaring can ultimately be logically reduced to what?	multiplication	5
1 This motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class.
2 A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X.
3 Thus no problem in C is harder than X since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C Of course the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used.
4 For complexity classes larger than P polynomialtime reductions are commonly used.
5 In particular the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of NPhard problems.
6 The complexity of problems often depends on what?	the type of reduction being used	3
7 What would create a conflict between a problem X and problem C within the context of reduction?	if every problem in C can be reduced to X	2
8 An algorithm for X which reduces to C would us to do what?	solve any problem in C	3
9 A problem set that that is hard for the expression NP can also be stated how?	NPhard	5
1 If a problem X is in C and hard for C then X is said to be complete for C This means that X is the hardest problem in C Since many problems could be equally hard one might say that X is one of the hardest problems in C Thus the class of NPcomplete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P Because the problem P  NP is not solved being able to reduce a known NPcomplete problem Π2 to another problem Π1 would indicate that there is no known polynomialtime solution for Π1.
2 This is because a polynomialtime solution to Π1 would yield a polynomialtime solution to Π2.
3 Similarly because all NP problems can be reduced to the set finding an NPcomplete problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P  NP.
4 The hardest problems in NP can be analogously written as what class of problems?	NPcomplete	1
5 NP complete problems contain the lowest likelihood of being located in what problem class?	NP	1
6 If P  NP is unsolved and reduction is applied to a known NPcomplete problem vis a vis Π2 to  Π1 what conclusion can be drawn for Π1?	there is no known polynomialtime solution	1
7 If polynomial time can be utilized within an NPcomplete problem what does the imply P is equal to?	NP	1
1 The complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm.
2 This hypothesis is called the Cobham–Edmonds thesis.
3 The complexity class NP on the other hand contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently but for which no efficient algorithm is known such as the Boolean satisfiability problem the Hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem.
4 Since deterministic Turing machines are special nondeterministic Turing machines it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP.
5 What complexity class is characterized by a computational tasks and efficient algorithms?	P	1
6 What hypothesis is associated with the complexity class of P viewed as a mathematical abstraction with efficient algorithmic functionality?	Cobham–Edmonds thesis	2
7 What complexity class is commonly characterized by unknown algorithms to enhance solvability?	NP	3
8 What is an example of a problem that rests within the NP complexity class?	Boolean satisfiability problem	3
9 In what theoretical machine is it confirmed that a problem in P belies membership in the NP class?	Turing machines	4
1 The question of whether P equals NP is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide implications of a solution.
2 If the answer is yes many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions.
3 These include various types of integer programming problems in operations research many problems in logistics protein structure prediction in biology and the ability to find formal proofs of pure mathematics theorems.
4 The P versus NP problem is one of the Millennium Prize Problems proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute.
5 There is a US1000000 prize for resolving the problem.
6 If P is ultimately proven to be equal tot NP what effect would this have on the efficiency of problems?	more efficient solutions	2
7 What is a particular problem in biology that would benefit from determining that P  NP?	protein structure prediction	3
8 What is the prize offered for finding a solution to PNP?	1 000 000	5
1 It was shown by Ladner that if P ≠ NP then there exist problems in NP that are neither in P nor NPcomplete.
2 Such problems are called NPintermediate problems.
3 The graph isomorphism problem the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be NPintermediate.
4 They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in P or to be NPcomplete.
5 Who demonstrated that P NP implies problems not present in P or NPcomplete?	Ladner	1
6 What is the name for a problem that meets Ladners assertion?	NPintermediate problems	2
7 What is an example of an NPintermediate problem not known to exist in P or NPcomplete?	graph isomorphism problem	3
1 The graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic.
2 An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P NPcomplete or NPintermediate.
3 The answer is not known but it is believed that the problem is at least not NPcomplete.
4 If graph isomorphism is NPcomplete the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level.

1 The integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer.
2 Phrased as a decision problem it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems such as the RSA algorithm.
3 The integer factorization problem is in NP and in coNP and even in UP and coUP.
4 If the problem is NPcomplete the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level ie NP will equal coNP.
5 The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve which takes time Oe64913nlog 213log nlog 223 to factor an nbit integer.

1 Many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal but this has not been proved.
2 For instance P ⊆ NP ⊆ PP ⊆ PSPACE but it is possible that P  PSPACE.
3 If P is not equal to NP then P is not equal to PSPACE either.
4 Since there are many known complexity classes between P and PSPACE such as RP BPP PP BQP MA PH etc it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class.
5 Proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory.
6 What is the unproven assumption generally ascribed to the value of complexity classes?	suspected to be unequal	1
7 What is an expression that can be used to illustrate the suspected inequality of complexity classes?	P ⊆ NP ⊆ PP ⊆ PSPACE	2
8 Where can the complexity classes RP BPP PP BQP MA and PH be located?	between P and PSPACE	4
9 What evidence between and among complexity classes would signify a theoretical watershed for complexity theory?	Proving that any of these classes are unequal	5

2 problems with the yesno answers reversed of NP problems.
3 It is believed that NP is not equal to coNP however it has not yet been proven.
4 It has been shown that if these two complexity classes are not equal then P is not equal to NP.

1 Problems that can be solved in theory eg given large but finite time but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful are known as intractable problems.
2 In complexity theory problems that lack polynomialtime solutions are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs.
3 In fact the Cobham–Edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device.
4 Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIMEhard.
5 If NP is not the same as P then the NPcomplete problems are also intractable in this sense.
6 To see why exponentialtime algorithms might be unusable in practice consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting.
7 For small n say 100 and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second the program would run for about 4 × 1010 years which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe.
8 Even with a much faster computer the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress.
9 Nevertheless a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical.
10 If its running time is say n15 it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances.
11 Problems capable of theoretical solutions but consuming unreasonable time in practical application are known as what?	intractable problems	1
12 Intractable problems lacking polynomial time solutions necessarily negate the practical efficacy of what type of algorithm?	exponentialtime algorithms	6
13 If NP is not equal to P viewed through this lens what type of problems can also be considered intractable?	NPcomplete problems	5
1 What intractability means in practice is open to debate.
2 Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are.
3 For example the decision problem in Presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in P yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases.
4 Similarly algorithms can solve the NPcomplete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and SAT solvers routinely handle large instances of the NPcomplete Boolean satisfiability problem.
5 What eponymous variation of arithmetic presents a decision problem not evidenced in P?	Presburger arithmetic	3
6 Despite the Presburger problem and in view of intractability what has been done to establish solutions in reasonable periods of time?	algorithms have been written	3
7 What is an example of a problem to which effective algorithms have provided a solution in spite of the intractability associated with the breadth of sizes?	NPcomplete knapsack problem	4
8 How quickly can an algorithm solve an NPcomplete knapsack problem?	in less than quadratic time	4
9 What is the example of another problem characterized by large instances that is routinely solved by SAT handlers employing efficient algorithms?	NPcomplete Boolean satisfiability problem	4

1 Teaching using pedagogy also involve assessing the educational levels of the students on particular skills.
2 Understanding the pedagogy of the students in a classroom involves using differentiated instruction as well as supervision to meet the needs of all students in the classroom.
3 Pedagogy can be thought of in two manners.
4 First teaching itself can be taught in many different ways hence using a pedagogy of teaching styles.
5 Second the pedagogy of the learners comes into play when a teacher assesses the pedagogic diversity of hisher students and differentiates for the individual students accordingly.
6 For example an experienced teacher and parent described the place of a teacher in learning as follows The real bulk of learning takes place in selfstudy and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop.
7 The function of the teacher is to pressure the lazy inspire the bored deflate the cocky encourage the timid detect and correct individual flaws and broaden the viewpoint of all.

1 Perhaps the most significant difference between primary school and secondary school teaching is the relationship between teachers and children.
2 In primary schools each class has a teacher who stays with them for most of the week and will teach them the whole curriculum.
3 In secondary schools they will be taught by different subject specialists each session during the week and may have ten or more different teachers.

1 This is true throughout most of the United States as well.
2 However alternative approaches for primary education do exist.
3 One of these sometimes referred to as a platoon system involves placing a group of students together in one class that moves from one specialist to another for every subject.
4 The advantage here is that students learn from teachers who specialize in one subject and who tend to be more knowledgeable in that one area than a teacher who teaches many subjects.
5 Students still derive a strong sense of security by staying with the same group of peers for all classes.

1 Whilst this is the consensus viewpoint amongst the majority of academics some teachers and parents advocate a more assertive and confrontational style of discipline.
2 citation needed Such individuals claim that many problems with modern schooling stem from the weakness in school discipline and if teachers exercised firm control over the classroom they would be able to teach more efficiently.

1 Where school class sizes are typically 40 to 50 students maintaining order in the classroom can divert the teacher from instruction leaving little opportunity for concentration and focus on what is being taught.
2 In response teachers may concentrate their attention on motivated students ignoring attentionseeking and disruptive students.
3 The result of this is that motivated students facing demanding university entrance examinations receive disproportionate resources.
4 Given the emphasis on attainment of university places administrators and governors may regard this policy as appropriate.
5 What class sizes can make keeping order difficult?	40 to 50 students	1
6 If the teacher focuses on maintaining order what does this take time away from?	instruction	1

1 Sudbury model democratic schools claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike.
2 They also claim that in these schools the preservation of public order is easier and more efficient than anywhere else.
3 Primarily because rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole thence the school atmosphere is one of persuasion and negotiation rather than confrontation since there is no one to confront.
4 Sudbury model democratic schools proponents argue that a school that has good clear laws fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws is a school in which community discipline prevails and in which an increasingly sophisticated concept of law and order develops against other schools today where rules are arbitrary authority is absolute punishment is capricious and due process of law is unknown.

1 Since teachers can affect how students perceive the course materials it has been found that teachers who showed enthusiasm towards the course materials and students can affect a positive learning experience towards the course materials.
2 On teachercourse evaluations it was found that teachers who have a positive disposition towards the course content tend to transfer their passion to receptive students.
3 These teachers do not teach by rote but attempt to find new invigoration for the course materials on a daily basis.
4 One of the difficulties in this approach is that teachers may have repeatedly covered a curriculum until they begin to feel bored with the subject which in turn bores the students as well.
5 Students who had enthusiastic teachers tend to rate them higher than teachers who didnt show much enthusiasm for the course materials.
6 What must a teacher show towards the course materials for increase learning?	enthusiasm	1
7 What gets transferred to students who are receptive to the teacher?	passion	2
8 What do these teachers NOT do?	teach by rote	3
9 How do students rate teachers that they feel are enthusiastic?	higher	5
1 Teachers that exhibit enthusiasm can lead to students who are more likely to be engaged interested energetic and curious about learning the subject matter.
2 Recent research has found a correlation between teacher enthusiasm and students intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom.
3 Controlled experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm such as demonstrative gesturing dramatic movements which are varied and emotional facial expressions result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn.
4 Students who experienced a very enthusiastic teacher were more likely to read lecture material outside of the classroom.
5 What increases students motivation to learn?	teacher enthusiasm	2
6 Students exposed to an enthusiastic teacher usually did what more often outside class?	read lecture material	4
7 What is dramatic gesturing an example of?	nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm	3
8 What type of studies explored student motivation?	Controlled  experimental studies	3
9 Nonverbal expressions resulted in what kind of levels of motivation to learn?	higher	3
1 There are various mechanisms by which teacher enthusiasm may facilitate higher levels of intrinsic motivation.

1 In accordance with his fathers wishes Luther enrolled in law school at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately believing that law represented uncertainty.
2 Luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy expressing particular interest in Aristotle William of Ockham and Gabriel Biel.
3 He was deeply influenced by two tutors Bartholomaeus Arnoldi von Usingen and Jodocus Trutfetter who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience.
4 Philosophy proved to be unsatisfying offering assurance about the use of reason but none about loving God which to Luther was more important.
5 Reason could not lead men to God he felt and he thereafter developed a lovehate relationship with Aristotle over the latters emphasis on reason.

2 He enclosed in his letter a copy of his Disputation of Martin Luther on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences which came to be known as The NinetyFive Theses.
3 Hans Hillerbrand writes that Luther had no intention of confronting the church but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices and the tone of the writing is accordingly searching rather than doctrinaire.
4 Hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses particularly in Thesis 86 which asks Why does the pope whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest Crassus build the basilica of St Peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money.

1 From 1510 to 1520 Luther lectured on the Psalms the books of Hebrews Romans and Galatians.
2 As he studied these portions of the Bible he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Catholic Church in new ways.
3 He became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity.
4 The most important for Luther was the doctrine of justification – Gods act of declaring a sinner righteous – by faith alone through Gods grace.
5 He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of Gods grace attainable only through faith in Jesus as the Messiah.
6 This one and firm rock which we call the doctrine of justification he wrote is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine which comprehends the understanding of all godliness.

2 This teaching by Luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication On the Bondage of the Will which was written in response to On Free Will by Desiderius Erasmus 1524.
3 Luther based his position on predestination on St Pauls epistle to the Ephesians 28–10.
4 Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ imputed to Christians rather than infused into them through faith.
5 That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law he wrote.
6 Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ.
7 Faith for Luther was a gift from God the experience of being justified by faith was as though I had been born again.
8 His entry into Paradise no less was a discovery about the righteousness of God – a discovery that the just person of whom the Bible speaks as in Romans 117 lives by faith.
9 He explained his concept of justification in the Smalcald Articles.

2 Over the next three years he deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against Luther which served only to harden the reformers antipapal theology.
3 First the Dominican theologian Sylvester Mazzolini drafted a heresy case against Luther whom Leo then summoned to Rome.
4 The Elector Frederick persuaded the pope to have Luther examined at Augsburg where the Imperial Diet was held.
5 There in October 1518 under questioning by papal legate Cardinal Cajetan Luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical Church because historistical interpretation of Bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the Antichrist.
6 The prophecies concerning the Antichrist soon became the center of controversy.
7 The hearings degenerated into a shouting match.
8 More than his writing the 95 Theses Luthers confrontation with the church cast him as an enemy of the pope.

2 Luther made certain concessions to the Saxon who was a relative of the Elector and promised to remain silent if his opponents did.
3 The theologian Johann Eck however was determined to expose Luthers doctrine in a public forum.
4 In June and July 1519 he staged a disputation with Luthers colleague Andreas Karlstadt at Leipzig and invited Luther to speak.
5 Luthers boldest assertion in the debate was that Matthew 1618 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible.
6 For this Eck branded Luther a new Jan Hus referring to the Czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415.

3 Karl von Miltitz a papal nuncio attempted to broker a solution but Luther who had sent the Pope a copy of On the Freedom of a Christian in October publicly set fire to the bull and decretals at Wittenberg on 10 December 1520 an act he defended in Why the Pope and his Recent Book are Burned and Assertions Concerning All Articles.

4 During his stay at Wartburg which he referred to as my Patmos Luther translated the New Testament from Greek into German and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings.

3 His essay On Confession Whether the Pope has the Power to Require It rejected compulsory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution since every Christian is a confessor.

1 Despite his victory in Wittenberg Luther was unable to stifle radicalism further afield.
2 Preachers such as Zwickau prophet Nicholas Storch and Thomas Müntzer helped instigate the German Peasants War of 1524–25 during which many atrocities were committed often in Luthers name.
3 There had been revolts by the peasantry on a smaller scale since the 15th century.
4 Luthers pamphlets against the Church and the hierarchy often worded with liberal phraseology now led many peasants to believe he would support an attack on the upper classes in general.
5 Revolts broke out in Franconia Swabia and Thuringia in 1524 even drawing support from disaffected nobles many of whom were in debt.
6 Gaining momentum under the leadership of radicals such as Müntzer in Thuringia and Michael Gaismair in Tyrol the revolts turned into war.

1 Luther sympathised with some of the peasants grievances as he showed in his response to the Twelve Articles in May 1525 but he reminded the aggrieved to obey the temporal authorities.
2 During a tour of Thuringia he became enraged at the widespread burning of convents monasteries bishops palaces and libraries.
3 In Against the Murderous Thieving Hordes of Peasants written on his return to Wittenberg he gave his interpretation of the Gospel teaching on wealth condemned the violence as the devils work and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs.

7 How did Luther express the destruction?	the devils work	3
8 Who did Luther call on to stop the revolt?	the nobles	3
1 Luther justified his opposition to the rebels on three grounds.
2 First in choosing violence over lawful submission to the secular government they were ignoring Christs counsel to Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesars St Paul had written in his epistle to the Romans 131–7 that all authorities are appointed by God and therefore should not be resisted.
3 This reference from the Bible forms the foundation for the doctrine known as the Divine Right of Kings or in the German case the divine right of the princes.
4 Second the violent actions of rebelling robbing and plundering placed the peasants outside the law of God and Empire so they deserved death in body and soul if only as highwaymen and murderers.
5 Lastly Luther charged the rebels with blasphemy for calling themselves Christian brethren and committing their sinful acts under the banner of the Gospel.

1 Without Luthers backing for the uprising many rebels laid down their weapons others felt betrayed.
2 Their defeat by the Swabian League at the Battle of Frankenhausen on 15 May 1525 followed by Müntzers execution brought the revolutionary stage of the Reformation to a close.
3 Thereafter radicalism found a refuge in the anabaptist movement and other religious movements while Luthers Reformation flourished under the wing of the secular powers.

3 Luther had written to George Spalatin on 30 November 1524 I shall never take a wife as I feel at present.
4 Not that I am insensible to my flesh or sex for I am neither wood nor stone but my mind is averse to wedlock because I daily expect the death of a heretic.

1 By 1526 Luther found himself increasingly occupied in organising a new church.
2 His Biblical ideal of congregations choosing their own ministers had proved unworkable.
3 According to Bainton Luthers dilemma was that he wanted both a confessional church based on personal faith and experience and a territorial church including all in a given locality.
4 If he were forced to choose he would take his stand with the masses and this was the direction in which he moved.
5 From 1525 to 1529 he established a supervisory church body laid down a new form of worship service and wrote a clear summary of the new faith in the form of two catechisms.
6 Luthers thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a theology of the cross the negation of every affirmation as long as the cross is at the center the system building tendency of reason is held in check and system building does not degenerate into System.

1 To avoid confusing or upsetting the people Luther avoided extreme change.
2 He also did not wish to replace one controlling system with another.
3 He concentrated on the church in the Electorate of Saxony acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories many of which followed his Saxon model.
4 He worked closely with the new elector John the Steadfast to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with Rome.
5 For Luthers biographer Martin Brecht this partnership was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign.
6 The elector authorised a visitation of the church a power formerly exercised by bishops.
7 At times Luthers practical reforms fell short of his earlier radical pronouncements.
8 For example the Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony 1528 drafted by Melanchthon with Luthers approval stressed the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins despite Luthers position that faith alone ensures justification.
9 The Eisleben reformer Johannes Agricola challenged this compromise and Luther condemned him for teaching that faith is separate from works.
10 The Instruction is a problematic document for those seeking a consistent evolution in Luthers thought and practice.

1 In response to demands for a German liturgy Luther wrote a German Mass which he published in early 1526.
2 He did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the Latin Mass but as an alternative for the simple people a public stimulation for people to believe and become Christians.
3 Luther based his order on the Catholic service but omitted everything that smacks of sacrifice and the Mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread.
4 He retained the elevation of the host and chalice while trappings such as the Mass vestments altar and candles were made optional allowing freedom of ceremony.
5 Some reformers including followers of Huldrych Zwingli considered Luthers service too papistic and modern scholars note the conservatism of his alternative to the Catholic mass.
6 Luthers service however included congregational singing of hymns and psalms in German as well as of parts of the liturgy including Luthers unison setting of the Creed.
7 To reach the simple people and the young Luther incorporated religious instruction into the weekday services in the form of the catechism.
8 He also provided simplified versions of the baptism and marriage services.

3 The catechisms provided easytounderstand instructional and devotional material on the Ten Commandments the Apostles Creed the Lords Prayer baptism and the Lords Supper.
4 Luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of Christian faith would not just be learned by rote the way monkeys do it but understood.

1 The catechism is one of Luthers most personal works.
2 Regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes he wrote I am quite cool and not at all eager about it because roused by a Saturnian hunger I would rather see them all devoured.
3 For I acknowledge none of them to be really a book of mine except perhaps the Bondage of the Will and the Catechism.
4 The Small Catechism has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching.
5 It remains in use today along with Luthers hymns and his translation of the Bible.

2 Using the German vernacular they expressed the Apostles Creed in simpler more personal Trinitarian language.
3 He rewrote each article of the Creed to express the character of the Father the Son or the Holy Spirit.
4 Luthers goal was to enable the catechumens to see themselves as a personal object of the work of the three persons of the Trinity each of which works in the catechumens life.
5 That is Luther depicted the Trinity not as a doctrine to be learned but as persons to be known.
6 The Father creates the Son redeems and the Spirit sanctifies a divine unity with separate personalities.
7 Salvation originates with the Father and draws the believer to the Father.
8 Luthers treatment of the Apostles Creed must be understood in the context of the Decalogue the Ten Commandments and the Lords Prayer which are also part of the Lutheran catechical teaching.

1 Luther had published his German translation of the New Testament in 1522 and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the Old Testament in 1534 when the whole Bible was published.
2 He continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life.
3 Others had translated the Bible into German but Luther tailored his translation to his own doctrine.
4 When he was criticised for inserting the word alone after faith in Romans 328 he replied in part The text itself and the meaning of St Paul urgently require and demand it.
5 For in that very passage he is dealing with the main point of Christian doctrine namely that we are justified by faith in Christ without any works of the Law.
6 .
7 But when works are so completely cut away – and that must mean that faith alone justifies – whoever would speak plainly and clearly about this cutting away of works will have to say Faith alone justifies us and not works.

2 Luthers hymn adapted and expanded from an earlier German creedal hymn gained widespread use in vernacular Lutheran liturgies as early as 1525.
3 Sixteenthcentury Lutheran hymnals also included Wir glauben all among the catechetical hymns although 18thcentury hymnals tended to label the hymn as Trinitarian rather than catechetical and 20thcentury Lutherans rarely use the hymn because of the perceived difficulty of its tune.

2 The hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the Lords Prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions.
3 The extant manuscript shows multiple revisions demonstrating Luthers concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune.

2 In a collaboration with Paul Speratus this and seven other hymns were published in the Achtliederbuch the first Lutheran hymnal.
3 In 1524 Luther developed his original fourstanza psalm paraphrase into a fivestanza Reformation hymn that developed the theme of grace alone more fully.
4 Because it expressed essential Reformation doctrine this expanded version of Aus tiefer Not was designated as a regular component of several regional Lutheran liturgies and was widely used at funerals including Luthers own.

1 In contrast to the views of John Calvin and Philipp Melanchthon throughout his life Luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a Christians soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death and accordingly he disputed traditional interpretations of some Bible passages such as the parable of the rich man and Lazarus.
2 This also led Luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints It is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace.
3 He also rejected the existence of Purgatory which involved Christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death.

1 The theologians including Zwingli Melanchthon Martin Bucer and Johannes Oecolampadius differed on the significance of the words spoken by Jesus at the Last Supper This is my body which is for you and This cup is the new covenant in my blood 1 Corinthians 1123–26.
2 Luther insisted on the Real Presence of the body and blood of Christ in the consecrated bread and wine which he called the sacramental union while his opponents believed God to be only spiritually or symbolically present.
3 Zwingli for example denied Jesus ability to be in more than one place at a time but Luther stressed the omnipresence of his human nature.
4 According to transcripts the debate sometimes became confrontational.
5 Citing Jesus words The flesh profiteth nothing John 663 Zwingli said This passage breaks your neck.
6 Dont be too proud Luther retorted German necks dont break that easily.
7 This is Hesse not Switzerland.
8 On his table Luther wrote the words Hoc est corpus meum This is my body in chalk to continually indicate his firm stance.

13 What did the meeting often become in argument?	confrontational	4
1 Despite the disagreements on the Eucharist the Marburg Colloquy paved the way for the signing in 1530 of the Augsburg Confession and for the formation of the Schmalkaldic League the following year by leading Protestant nobles such as John of Saxony Philip of Hesse and George Margrave of BrandenburgAnsbach.
2 The Swiss cities however did not sign these agreements.

1 Some scholars have asserted that Luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason.
2 He wrote All the articles of our Christian faith which God has revealed to us in His Word are in presence of reason sheerly impossible absurd and false.
3 and That Reason in no way contributes to faith.
4  For reason is the greatest enemy that faith has it never comes to the aid of spiritual things.
5 However though seemingly contradictorily he also wrote in the latter work that human reason strives not against faith when enlightened but rather furthers and advances it bringing claims he was a fideist into dispute.
6 Contemporary Lutheran scholarship however has found a different reality in Luther.
7 Luther rather seeks to separate faith and reason in order to honor the separate spheres of knowledge that each applies to.
8 Bernhard Lohse for example has demonstrated in his classic work Fides und Ratio that Luther ultimately sought to put the two together.
9 More recently HansPeter Grosshans has demonstrated that Luthers work on Biblical Criticism stresses the need for external coherence in the right exegetical method.
10 This means that for Luther it is more important that the Bible is reasonable according to the reality outside of the scriptures than that the Bible makes sense to itself that it has internal coherence.
11 The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason which for him is the field of science philosophy history and empirical observation.
12 Here a different picture is presented of a Luther who deeply valued both faith and reason and held them in dialectical partnership.
13 Luthers concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres.
14 What do scholars sometimes assert that Luther believed about what faith and reason were to each other?	antithetical	1
15 What did Luther think that faith could not be understood by?	reason	1
16 How did Luther say that reason contributes to faith?	no way contributes	3
17 What was faiths greatest enemy according to Luther?	reason	4
18 By separating faith and reason what does Luther honor?	different epistemological spheres	13
1 In 1523 Luther wrote that Jesus Christ was born a Jew which discouraged mistreatment of the Jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the Old Testament could be shown to speak of Jesus Christ.
2 However as the Reformation continued Luther began to lose hope in largescale Jewish conversion to Christianity.
3 In his later years Luther grew more hostile toward the Jews writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the Anabaptists Zwinglianism and the papacy.
4 His 1543 treatise Von den Juden und ihren Lügen On the Jews and Their Lies took its place among other antiJewish literature of the times although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme even by the standards of sixteenth century Europe.
5 In it he takes a hardline against Judaism writing that synagogues and Jewish homes should be destroyed their money confiscated and liberty curtailed.
6 These statements and their influence on antisemitism have contributed to his controversial status.
7 What did Luther state as a means of discouraging mistreatment of Jews?	Jesus Christ was born a Jew	1
8 What did Luther gradually see as hopeless in the Reformation?	Jewish conversion to Christianity	2
9 Who did Luther strike out against in later years?	Jews	3
10 Luther treated Jews in a like way as he treated what group?	Anabaptists	3
11 When did Luther write an extreme treatise against the Jews?	1543	4
1 At the time of the Marburg Colloquy Suleiman the Magnificent was besieging Vienna with a vast Ottoman army.
2 Luther had argued against resisting the Turks in his 1518 Explanation of the Ninetyfive Theses provoking accusations of defeatism.
3 He saw the Turks as a scourge sent to punish Christians by God as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist whom Luther believed to be the papacy and the Roman Church.
4 He consistently rejected the idea of a Holy War as though our people were an army of Christians against the Turks who were enemies of Christ.
5 This is absolutely contrary to Christs doctrine and name.
6 On the other hand in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms Luther did support nonreligious war against the Turks.
7 In 1526 he argued in Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace that national defence is reason for a just war.
8 By 1529 in On War against the Turk he was actively urging Emperor Charles V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks.
9 He made clear however that the spiritual war against an alien faith was separate to be waged through prayer and repentance.
10 Around the time of the Siege of Vienna Luther wrote a prayer for national deliverance from the Turks asking God to give to our emperor perpetual victory over our enemies.
11 How did Luther view the Ottoman Turks?	as a scourge	3
12 What was the purpose of the Turks in Luthers mind?	to punish Christians	3
13 Since Luther believed that the Turks were sent by God what was their purpose?	destroy the antichrist	3
14 Who did Luther view to be the Antichrist?	the papacy	3
15 What kind of war did Luther support against the Turks even if he did not oppose a religious war?	secular war	8
1 In 1542 Luther read a Latin translation of the Quran.
2 He went on to produce several critical pamphlets on Islam which he called Mohammedanism or the Turk.
3 Though Luther saw the Muslim faith as a tool of the devil he was indifferent to its practice Let the Turk believe and live as he will just as one lets the papacy and other false Christians live.
4 He opposed banning the publication of the Quran wanting it exposed to scrutiny.
5 What book did Luther read in 1542?	Quran	1
6 What type of writings did the reading of the Quran bring out in Luther?	critical pamphlets on Islam	2
7 What were Mohammedanism and the Turk?	Islam	2
8 How did Luther view Islam?	tool of the devil	3
9 What purpose would Luther have in not wanting to ban the Quran?	exposed to scrutiny	4
1 Early in 1537 Johannes Agricola 1494–1566 – serving at the time as pastor in Luthers birthplace Eisleben – preached a sermon in which he claimed that Gods gospel not Gods moral law the Ten Commandments revealed Gods wrath to Christians.
2 Based on this sermon and others by Agricola Luther suspected that Agricola was behind certain anonymous antinomian theses circulating in Wittenberg.
3 These theses asserted that the law is no longer to be taught to Christians but belonged only to city hall.
4 Luther responded to these theses with six series of theses against Agricola and the antinomians four of which became the basis for disputations between 1538 and 1540.
5 He also responded to these assertions in other writings such as his 1539 open letter to C Güttel Against the Antinomians and his book On the Councils and the Church from the same year.
6 What did Johannes Agricola preach that Gods gospel revealed?	Gods wrath to Christians	1
7 Who did Luther think was behind the antinomian theses circulating in Wittenberg?	Johannes Agricola	1
8 What did Agricola apparently believe about who should be in control  law?	city hall	3
9 How did Luther respond to Agricola?	theses against Agricola	4
10 What book did Luther write in response to Agricola and the antinomians?	On the Councils and the Church	5
1 In his theses and disputations against the antinomians Luther reviews and reaffirms on the one hand what has been called the second use of the law that is the law as the Holy Spirits tool to work sorrow over sin in mans heart thus preparing him for Christs fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel.
2 Luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law even if it is Christs life Christs death for sin or Gods goodness experienced in creation.
3 Simply refusing to preach the Ten Commandments among Christians – thereby as it were removing the three letters law from the church – does not eliminate the accusing law.
4 Claiming that the law – in any form – should not be preached to Christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that Christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people.
5 What did Luthers answer to the antinomians reaffirms?	second use of the law	1
6 What is the use of the law by the Holy Spirit?	work sorrow over sin	1
7 What is Luthers opinion of what the law covers?	everything	2
8 What does refusing to preach the Ten Commandments not do?	eliminate the accusing law	3
9 What did Luther claim the church would have to comprise if the law were not taught?	essentially holy people	4
1 On the other hand Luther also points out that the Ten Commandments – when considered not as Gods condemning judgment but as an expression of his eternal will that is of the natural law – also positively teach how the Christian ought to live.
2 This has traditionally been called the third use of the law.
3 For Luther also Christs life when understood as an example is nothing more than an illustration of the Ten Commandments which a Christian should follow in his or her vocations on a daily basis.
4 What do the Ten Commandments teach Christians how to do?	ought to live	1
5 What is Gods expression of eternal will according to Luther?	Ten Commandments	1
6 Teaching Christians how they should live is what use of the law?	third use of the law	2
7 What did Luther consider Christs life?	illustration of the Ten Commandments	3
8 What should a Christian follow in his life?	Ten Commandments	3
1 The Ten Commandments and the beginnings of the renewed life of Christians accorded to them by the sacrament of baptism are a present foreshadowing of the believers future angellike life in heaven in the midst of this life.
2 Luthers teaching of the Ten Commandments therefore has clear eschatological overtones which characteristically for Luther do not encourage worldflight but direct the Christian to service to the neighbor in the common daily vocations of this perishing world.
3 What sacrament accords Christians renewed life?	baptism	1
4 Besides baptism what shows the future of heaven to Christians?	Ten Commandments	1
5 What does the Ten Commandments ask of the Christians?	service to the neighbor	2
1 From December 1539 Luther became implicated in the bigamy of Philip I Landgrave of Hesse who wanted to marry one of his wifes ladiesinwaiting.
2 Philip solicited the approval of Luther Melanchthon and Bucer citing as a precedent the polygamy of the patriarchs.
3 The theologians were not prepared to make a general ruling and they reluctantly advised the landgrave that if he was determined he should marry secretly and keep quiet about the matter.
4 As a result on 4 March 1540 Philip married a second wife Margarethe von der Saale with Melanchthon and Bucer among the witnesses.
5 However Philip was unable to keep the marriage secret and he threatened to make Luthers advice public.
6 Luther told him to tell a good strong lie and deny the marriage completely which Philip did during the subsequent public controversy.
7 In the view of Luthers biographer Martin Brecht giving confessional advice for Philip of Hesse was one of the worst mistakes Luther made and next to the landgrave himself who was directly responsible for it history chiefly holds Luther accountable.
8 Brecht argues that Luthers mistake was not that he gave private pastoral advice but that he miscalculated the political implications.
9 The affair caused lasting damage to Luthers reputation.
10 What did Philip I wish to do around 1539?	wanted to marry	1
11 What did Luther get implicated in concerning Philip I?	bigamy	1
12 Who did Philip I want to marry?	one of his wifes ladiesinwaiting	1
13 Who does history view as accountable for the error Philip I made and Luthers advice in the matter?	holds Luther accountable	7
14 What did this affair cause to Luthers reputation?	lasting damage	9
1 Luther wrote about the Jews throughout his career though only a few of his works dealt with them directly.
2 Luther rarely encountered Jews during his life but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw Jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of Christ and he lived within a local community that had expelled Jews some ninety years earlier.
3 He considered the Jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of Jesus whereas Christians believed Jesus was the Messiah.
4 But Luther believed that all human beings who set themselves against God were equally guilty.
5 As early as 1516 he wrote that many people are proud with marvelous stupidity when they call the Jews dogs evildoers or whatever they like while they too and equally do not realize who or what they are in the sight of God.
6 In 1523 Luther advised kindness toward the Jews in That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew and also aimed to convert them to Christianity.
7 When his efforts at conversion failed he grew increasingly bitter toward them.
8 In his 2010 book Bonhoeffer Pastor Martyr Prophet Spy Christian author Eric Metaxas claimed that Luthers attitude towards Jews unraveled along with his health.
9 What had Luthers community done to Jews years earlier?	expelled Jews	2
10 Who did Luther write about but seldom met?	Jews	2
11 What did Luthers area and tradition believe Jews to be guilty of?	murder of Christ	2
12 What did Jews refuse to accept that caused Luther to call them blasphemers and liars?	divinity of Jesus	3
13 What did Luther try to do for the Jews?	convert them to Christianity	6
1 Luthers other major works on the Jews were his 60000word treatise Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen On the Jews and Their Lies and Vom Schem Hamphoras und vom Geschlecht Christi On the Holy Name and the Lineage of Christ both published in 1543 three years before his death.
2 Luther argued that the Jews were no longer the chosen people but the devils people and referred to them with violent vile language.
3 Citing Deuteronomy 13 wherein Moses commands the killing of idolaters and the burning of their cities and property as an offering to God Luther called for a scharfe Barmherzigkeit sharp mercy against the Jews to see whether we might save at least a few from the glowing flames.
4 Luther advocated setting synagogues on fire destroying Jewish prayerbooks forbidding rabbis from preaching seizing Jews property and money and smashing up their homes so that these envenomed worms would be forced into labour or expelled for all time.
5 In Robert Michaels view Luthers words We are at fault in not slaying them amounted to a sanction for murder.
6 Gods anger with them is so intense Luther concluded that gentle mercy will only tend to make them worse while sharp mercy will reform them but little.
7 Therefore in any case away with them.
8 What was Luthers major work of 60000 words on the Jews?	Von den Juden und Ihren Lügen	1
9 When was the large work published?	1543	1
10 How near to his death was the work published?	three years before	1
11 What did Luther contend the Jews to be?	the devils people	2
12 As what did Robert Michael view Luthers violent language towards the Jews?	sanction for murder	5
1 Luther spoke out against the Jews in Saxony Brandenburg and Silesia.
2 Josel of Rosheim the Jewish spokesman who tried to help the Jews of Saxony in 1537 later blamed their plight on that priest whose name was Martin Luther—may his body and soul be bound up in hell—who wrote and issued many heretical books in which he said that whoever would help the Jews was doomed to perdition.
3 Josel asked the city of Strasbourg to forbid the sale of Luthers antiJewish works they refused initially but did so when a Lutheran pastor in Hochfelden used a sermon to urge his parishioners to murder Jews.
4 Luthers influence persisted after his death.
5 Throughout the 1580s riots led to the expulsion of Jews from several German Lutheran states.
6 What did Luther speak out about in Saxony?	the Jews	1
7 Who did Josel of Rosheim blame for the condition of Jews in Saxony?	Martin Luther	2

10 When did riots cause the expulsion of Jews from several German states?	Throughout the 1580s	5
1 Luther was the most widely read author of his generation and within Germany he acquired the status of a prophet.
2 According to the prevailing view among historians his antiJewish rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in Germany and in the 1930s and 1940s provided an ideal underpinning for the Nazis attacks on Jews.
3 Reinhold Lewin writes that anybody who wrote against the Jews for whatever reason believed he had the right to justify himself by triumphantly referring to Luther.
4 According to Michael just about every antiJewish book printed in the Third Reich contained references to and quotations from Luther.
5 Heinrich Himmler wrote admiringly of his writings and sermons on the Jews in 1940.
6 The city of Nuremberg presented a first edition of On the Jews and their Lies to Julius Streicher editor of the Nazi newspaper Der Stürmer on his birthday in 1937 the newspaper described it as the most radically antiSemitic tract ever published.
7 It was publicly exhibited in a glass case at the Nuremberg rallies and quoted in a 54page explanation of the Aryan Law by Dr EH Schulz and Dr R Frercks.
8 Who was the most widely read writer of his generation?	Luther	1

12 How did Der Sturmer describe Luthers On the Jews and their Lies	radically antiSemitic 	6.
1 On 17 December 1941 seven Protestant regional church confederations issued a statement agreeing with the policy of forcing Jews to wear the yellow badge since after his bitter experience Luther had already suggested preventive measures against the Jews and their expulsion from German territory.
2 According to Daniel Goldhagen Bishop Martin Sasse a leading Protestant churchman published a compendium of Luthers writings shortly after Kristallnacht for which Diarmaid MacCulloch Professor of the History of the Church in the University of Oxford argued that Luthers writing was a blueprint.
3 Sasse applauded the burning of the synagogues and the coincidence of the day writing in the introduction On 10 November 1938 on Luthers birthday the synagogues are burning in Germany.
4 The German people he urged ought to heed these words of the greatest antisemite of his time the warner of his people against the Jews.

9 What did Sasse proclaim Luther to be?	greatest antisemite	4
1 At the heart of scholars debate about Luthers influence is whether it is anachronistic to view his work as a precursor of the racial antisemitism of the Nazis.
2 Some scholars see Luthers influence as limited and the Nazis use of his work as opportunistic.
3 Biographer Martin Brecht points out that There is a world of difference between his belief in salvation and a racial ideology.
4 Nevertheless his misguided agitation had the evil result that Luther fatefully became one of the church fathers of antiSemitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the Jews cloaking it with the authority of the Reformer.
5 Johannes Wallmann argues that Luthers writings against the Jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries and that there was no continuity between Luthers thought and Nazi ideology.
6 Uwe SiemonNetto agreed arguing that it was because the Nazis were already antiSemites that they revived Luthers work.
7 Hans J Hillerbrand agreed that to focus on Luther was to adopt an essentially ahistorical perspective of Nazi antisemitism that ignored other contributory factors in German history.
8 Similarly Roland Bainton noted church historian and Luther biographer wrote One could wish that Luther had died before ever On the Jews and Their Lies was written.
9 His position was entirely religious and in no respect racial.
10 How do some scholars view the Nazi use of Luthers work?	opportunistic	2
11 What did Martin Brecht call Luthers stand on the Jews?	misguided agitation	4
12 What did this agitation provide later generations material for?	modern hatred of the Jews	4
13 When was Luthers writings about the Jews ignored according to Johannes Wallmann?	18th and 19th centuries	5
14 What did Roland Bainton say about Luthers position on Jews?	religious and in no respect racial	9
1 Other scholars argue that even if his views were merely antiJudaic—that is opposed to Judaism and its adherence rather than the Jews as an ethnic group—their violence lent a new element to the standard Christian suspicion of Judaism.
2 Ronald Berger writes that Luther is credited with Germanizing the Christian critique of Judaism and establishing antiSemitism as a key element of German culture and national identity.
3 Paul Rose argues that he caused a hysterical and demonizing mentality about Jews to enter German thought and discourse a mentality that might otherwise have been absent.
4 Christopher J Probst in his book Demonizing the Jews Luther and the Protestant Church in Nazi Germany 2012 shows that a large number of German Lutheran clergy and theologians during the Nazi Third Reich used Luthers hostile publications towards the Jews and their Jewish religion to justify at least in part the antiSemitic policies of the National Socialists.
5 Other scholars contend that Luthers words lent what element to Christian suspicion of Jews?	violence	1
6 Who thinks that Luther added antisemitism as a cultural element to Germany?	Ronald Berger	2

8 Who aide the Reich in Germany in antisemitism?	Lutheran clergy and theologians	4
9 What did these Lutheran clerics use as fuel to bolster the Policies of the Nazis?	Luthers hostile publications	4
1 Some scholars such as Mark U Edwards in his book Luthers Last Battles Politics and Polemics 1531–46 1983 suggest that since Luthers increasingly antisemitic views developed during the years his health deteriorated it is possible they were at least partly the product of a declining state of mind.
2 Edwards also comments that Luther often deliberately used vulgarity and violence for effect both in his writings condemning the Jews and in diatribes against Turks Muslims and Catholics.
3 What does Mark U Edwards claim as a possible cause of Luthers antisemitism?	declining state of mind	1
4 What about Luther declined as his antisemitism increased?	his health	1

1 Since the 1980s Lutheran Church denominations have repudiated Martin Luthers statements against the Jews and have rejected the use of them to incite hatred against Lutherans.
2 Strommen et al.
3 s 1970 survey of 4745 North American Lutherans aged 15–65 found that compared to the other minority groups under consideration Lutherans were the least prejudiced toward Jews.
4 Nevertheless Professor Richard Dick Geary former Professor of Modern History at the University of Nottingham England and the author of Hitler and Nazism Routledge 1993 wrote in the journal History Today an article on who voted for the Nazis in elections held from 19281933 where he claimed that from his research he found that the Nazis gained disproportionately more votes from Protestant than Catholic areas of Germany.

1 Luther had been suffering from ill health for years including Ménières disease vertigo fainting tinnitus and a cataract in one eye.
2 From 1531 to 1546 his health deteriorated further.
3 The years of struggle with Rome the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers and the scandal which ensued from the bigamy of the Philip of Hesse incident in which Luther had played a leading role all may have contributed.

2 It was entirely devoted to the obdurate Jews whom it was a matter of great urgency to expel from all German territory according to Léon Poliakov.
3 James Mackinnon writes that it concluded with a fiery summons to drive the Jews bag and baggage from their midst unless they desisted from their calumny and their usury and became Christians.
4 Luther said we want to practice Christian love toward them and pray that they convert but also that they are our public enemies  and if they could kill us all they would gladly do so.

1 In the 1530s and 1540s printed images of Luther that emphasized his monumental size were crucial to the spread of Protestantism.
2 In contrast to images of frail Catholic saints Luther was presented as a stout man with a double chin strong mouth piercing deepset eyes fleshy face and squat neck.
3 He was shown to be physically imposing an equal in stature to the secular German princes with whom he would join forces to spread Lutheranism.

1 A term used originally in derision Huguenot has unclear origins.
2 Various hypotheses have been promoted.
3 The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues died 1532 and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten literally housemates referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse Confederates as in a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy.
4 Geneva was John Calvins adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement.
5 In Geneva Hugues though Catholic was a leader of the Confederate Party so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the citystate of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation.
6 The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church involved in the Amboise plot of 1560 a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise.

1 It is a logical extension of the compound engine described above to split the expansion into yet more stages to increase efficiency.
2 The result is the multiple expansion engine.
3 Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively.
4 These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter.
5 These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage.
6 As with the double expansion engine if space is at a premium then two smaller cylinders may be used for the lowpressure stage.
7 Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline but various other formations were used.
8 In the late 19th century the YarrowSchlickTweedy balancing system was used on some marine triple expansion engines.
9 YST engines divided the lowpressure expansion stages between two cylinders one at each end of the engine.
10 This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced resulting in a smoother fasterresponding engine which ran with less vibration.
11 This made the 4cylinder tripleexpansion engine popular with large passenger liners such as the Olympic class but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibrationfree turbine engine.

1 In the 1840s and 50s there were attempts to overcome this problem by means of various patent valve gears with a separate variable cutoff expansion valve riding on the back of the main slide valve the latter usually had fixed or limited cutoff.
2 The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events at the expense of increased friction and wear and the mechanism tended to be complicated.
3 The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cutoff on the admission side has occurred.
4 This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson Joy and Walschaerts motions.
5 Corliss and later poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms.

1 Lead fusible plugs may be present in the crown of the boilers firebox.
2 If the water level drops such that the temperature of the firebox crown increases significantly the lead melts and the steam escapes warning the operators who may then manually suppress the fire.
3 Except in the smallest of boilers the steam escape has little effect on dampening the fire.

1 In most reciprocating piston engines the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke counterflow entering and exhausting from the cylinder by the same port.
2 The complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes the cycle also comprises four events – admission expansion exhaust compression.
3 These events are controlled by valves often working inside a steam chest adjacent to the cylinder the valves distribute the steam by opening and closing steam ports communicating with the cylinder ends and are driven by valve gear of which there are many types.

1 Uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle where during each stroke the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy in restoring working temperature.
2 The aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction.
3 By this means the simpleexpansion uniflow engine gives efficiency equivalent to that of classic compound systems with the added advantage of superior partload performance and comparable efficiency to turbines for smaller engines below one thousand horsepower.

1 A method to lessen the magnitude of this heating and cooling was invented in 1804 by British engineer Arthur Woolf who patented his Woolf highpressure compound engine in 1805.
2 In the compound engine highpressure steam from the boiler expands in a highpressure HP cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lowerpressure LP cylinders.
3 The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each.
4 This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling increasing the efficiency of the engine.
5 By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders torque variability can be reduced.
6 To derive equal work from lowerpressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume.
7 Therefore the bore and often the stroke are increased in lowpressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders.

1 The first commercial steampowered device was a water pump developed in 1698 by Thomas Savery.
2 It used condensing steam to create a vacuum which was used to raise water from below then it used steam pressure to raise it higher.

1 Where CHP is not used steam turbines in power stations use surface condensers as a cold sink.
2 The condensers are cooled by water flow from oceans rivers lakes and often by cooling towers which evaporate water to provide cooling energy removal.
3 The resulting condensed hot water output from the condenser is then put back into the boiler via a pump.
4 A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly.
5 Evaporative wet cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water this water is kept separate from the condensate which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler.
6 Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air.
7 Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than oncethrough cooling by river or lake water a 700 megawatt coalfired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of makeup water every hour for evaporative cooling but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.

1 The centrifugal governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after Watt’s partner Boulton saw one at a flour mill Boulton  Watt were building.
2 The governor could not actually hold a set speed because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes.
3 The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler.
4 Also there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change.
5 As a consequence engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed such as cotton spinning.
6 The governor was improved over time and coupled with variable steam cut off good speed control in response to changes in load was attainable near the end of the 19th century.

1 The adoption of compounding was common for industrial units for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880 it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated.
2 This is partly due to the harsh railway operating environment and limited space afforded by the loading gauge particularly in Britain where compounding was never common and not employed after 1930.
3 However although never in the majority it was popular in many other countries.
4 After what year was compounding frequently used in marine engines?	1880	1

1 The simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction.
2 Most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually shortening the cutoff or rather shortening the admission event this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period.
3 However as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant if the exhaust event is too brief the totality of the exhaust steam cannot evacuate the cylinder choking it and giving excessive compression kick back.

1 A steam turbine consists of one or more rotors rotating discs mounted on a drive shaft alternating with a series of stators static discs fixed to the turbine casing.
2 The rotors have a propellerlike arrangement of blades at the outer edge.
3 Steam acts upon these blades producing rotary motion.
4 The stator consists of a similar but fixed series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage.
5 A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum.
6 The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam giving rise to a series of variably sized high and lowpressure stages.
7 Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications such as a ships propeller.
8 In the vast majority of large electric generating stations turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing.
9 Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute RPM in the USA with 60 Hertz power 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems.
10 In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM.
11 A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction.
12 Therefore a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.

1 The weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the powertoweight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines.
2 For mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors.
3 However most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant so that indirectly the worlds industry is still dependent on steam power.
4 Recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover.

1 It is possible to use a mechanism based on a pistonless rotary engine such as the Wankel engine in place of the cylinders and valve gear of a conventional reciprocating steam engine.
2 Many such engines have been designed from the time of James Watt to the present day but relatively few were actually built and even fewer went into quantity production see link at bottom of article for more details.
3 The major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steamtight in the face of wear and thermal expansion the resulting leakage made them very inefficient.
4 Lack of expansive working or any means of control of the cutoff is also a serious problem with many such designs.

1 The next major step occurred when James Watt developed 1763–1775 an improved version of Newcomens engine with a separate condenser.
2 Boulton and Watts early engines used half as much coal as John Smeatons improved version of Newcomens.
3 Newcomens and Watts early engines were atmospheric.
4 They were powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam instead of the pressure of expanding steam.
5 The engine cylinders had to be large because the only usable force acting on them was due to atmospheric pressure.

1 Steam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high one may be adjusted by the user the second is typically designed as an ultimate failsafe.
2 Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler.
3 One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure.
4 Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine.
5 The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable springloaded valve which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken.
6 This arrangement is considerably safer.

1 The acme of the horizontal engine was the Corliss steam engine patented in 1849 which was a fourvalve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff.
2 When Corliss was given the Rumford medal the committee said that no one invention since Watts time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine.

1 The steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory however the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam.
2 The experimental measurements made by Watt on a model steam engine led to the development of the separate condenser.
3 Watt independently discovered latent heat which was confirmed by the original discoverer Joseph Black who also advised Watt on experimental procedures.
4 Watt was also aware of the change in the boiling point of water with pressure.
5 Otherwise the improvements to the engine itself were more mechanical in nature.

1 One of the principal advantages the Rankine cycle holds over others is that during the compression stage relatively little work is required to drive the pump the working fluid being in its liquid phase at this point.
2 By condensing the fluid the work required by the pump consumes only 1 to 3 of the turbine power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle.
3 The benefit of this is lost somewhat due to the lower heat addition temperature.
4 Gas turbines for instance have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500 °C.
5 Nonetheless the efficiencies of actual large steam cycles and large modern gas turbines are fairly well matched.

1 Landbased steam engines could exhaust much of their steam as feed water was usually readily available.

1 Virtually all nuclear power plants generate electricity by heating water to provide steam that drives a turbine connected to an electrical generator.
2 Nuclearpowered ships and submarines either use a steam turbine directly for main propulsion with generators providing auxiliary power or else employ turboelectric transmission where the steam drives a turbo generator set with propulsion provided by electric motors.
3 A limited number of steam turbine railroad locomotives were manufactured.
4 Some noncondensing directdrive locomotives did meet with some success for long haul freight operations in Sweden and for express passenger work in Britain but were not repeated.
5 Elsewhere notably in the USA more advanced designs with electric transmission were built experimentally but not reproduced.
6 It was found that steam turbines were not ideally suited to the railroad environment and these locomotives failed to oust the classic reciprocating steam unit in the way that modern diesel and electric traction has done.

1 The Rankine cycle is sometimes referred to as a practical Carnot cycle because when an efficient turbine is used the TS diagram begins to resemble the Carnot cycle.
2 The main difference is that heat addition in the boiler and rejection in the condenser are isobaric constant pressure processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal constant temperature processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle.
3 In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas.
4 Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor as in the Carnot cycle.
5 The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and reevaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.

1 In the meantime on August 1 1774 an experiment conducted by the British clergyman Joseph Priestley focused sunlight on mercuric oxide HgO inside a glass tube which liberated a gas he named dephlogisticated air.
2 He noted that candles burned brighter in the gas and that a mouse was more active and lived longer while breathing it.

1 One of the first known experiments on the relationship between combustion and air was conducted by the 2nd century BCE Greek writer on mechanics Philo of Byzantium.
2 In his work Pneumatica Philo observed that inverting a vessel over a burning candle and surrounding the vessels neck with water resulted in some water rising into the neck.
3 Philo incorrectly surmised that parts of the air in the vessel were converted into the classical element fire and thus were able to escape through pores in the glass.

1 Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion.

1 John Daltons original atomic hypothesis assumed that all elements were monatomic and that the atoms in compounds would normally have the simplest atomic ratios with respect to one another.
2 For example Dalton assumed that waters formula was HO giving the atomic mass of oxygen as 8 times that of hydrogen instead of the modern value of about 16.
3 In 1805 Joseph Louis GayLussac and Alexander von Humboldt showed that water is formed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen and by 1811 Amedeo Avogadro had arrived at the correct interpretation of waters composition based on what is now called Avogadros law and the assumption of diatomic elemental molecules.

1 Highly combustible materials that leave little residue such as wood or coal were thought to be made mostly of phlogiston whereas noncombustible substances that corrode such as iron contained very little.
2 Air did not play a role in phlogiston theory nor were any initial quantitative experiments conducted to test the idea instead it was based on observations of what happens when something burns that most common objects appear to become lighter and seem to lose something in the process.
3 The fact that a substance like wood gains overall weight in burning was hidden by the buoyancy of the gaseous combustion products.
4 Indeed one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals too gain weight in rusting when they were supposedly losing phlogiston.

1 In this dioxygen the two oxygen atoms are chemically bonded to each other.
2 The bond can be variously described based on level of theory but is reasonably and simply described as a covalent double bond that results from the filling of molecular orbitals formed from the atomic orbitals of the individual oxygen atoms the filling of which results in a bond order of two.
3 More specifically the double bond is the result of sequential lowtohigh energy or Aufbau filling of orbitals and the resulting cancellation of contributions from the 2s electrons after sequential filling of the low σ and σ orbitals σ overlap of the two atomic 2p orbitals that lie along the OO molecular axis and π overlap of two pairs of atomic 2p orbitals perpendicular to the OO molecular axis and then cancellation of contributions from the remaining two of the six 2p electrons after their partial filling of the lowest π and π orbitals.

1 Oxygen was discovered independently by Carl Wilhelm Scheele in Uppsala in 1773 or earlier and Joseph Priestley in Wiltshire in 1774 but Priestley is often given priority because his work was published first.
2 The name oxygen was coined in 1777 by Antoine Lavoisier whose experiments with oxygen helped to discredit the thenpopular phlogiston theory of combustion and corrosion.
3 Its name derives from the Greek roots ὀξύς oxys acid literally sharp referring to the sour taste of acids and γενής genes producer literally begetter because at the time of naming it was mistakenly thought that all acids required oxygen in their composition.
4 Common uses of oxygen includes the production cycle of steel plastics and textiles brazing welding and cutting of steels and other metals rocket propellant in oxygen therapy and life support systems in aircraft submarines spaceflight and diving.

1 This combination of cancellations and σ and π overlaps results in dioxygens double bond character and reactivity and a triplet electronic ground state.
2 An electron configuration with two unpaired electrons as found in dioxygen see the filled π orbitals in the diagram orbitals that are of equal energy—ie degenerate—is a configuration termed a spin triplet state.
3 Hence the ground state of the O2 molecule is referred to as triplet oxygen.
4 b The highest energy partially filled orbitals are antibonding and so their filling weakens the bond order from three to two.

1 In one experiment Lavoisier observed that there was no overall increase in weight when tin and air were heated in a closed container.
2 He noted that air rushed in when he opened the container which indicated that part of the trapped air had been consumed.
3 He also noted that the tin had increased in weight and that increase was the same as the weight of the air that rushed back in.
4 This and other experiments on combustion were documented in his book Sur la combustion en général which was published in 1777.
5 In that work he proved that air is a mixture of two gases vital air which is essential to combustion and respiration and azote Gk.

1 Trioxygen O3 is usually known as ozone and is a very reactive allotrope of oxygen that is damaging to lung tissue.
2 Ozone is produced in the upper atmosphere when O2 combines with atomic oxygen made by the splitting of O2 by ultraviolet UV radiation.
3 Since ozone absorbs strongly in the UV region of the spectrum the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere functions as a protective radiation shield for the planet.
4 Near the Earths surface it is a pollutant formed as a byproduct of automobile exhaust.
5 The metastable molecule tetraoxygen O4 was discovered in 2001 and was assumed to exist in one of the six phases of solid oxygen.
6 It was proven in 2006 that this phase created by pressurizing O2 to 20 GPa is in fact a rhombohedral O8 cluster.
7 This cluster has the potential to be a much more powerful oxidizer than either O2 or O3 and may therefore be used in rocket fuel.

1 By the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it.

4 Just two days later French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen.
5 Only a few drops of the liquid were produced in either case so no meaningful analysis could be conducted.

3 In nature singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis using the energy of sunlight.
4 It is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen.

2 Seawater molecules that contain the lighter isotope oxygen16 evaporate at a slightly faster rate than water molecules containing the 12 heavier oxygen18 this disparity increases at lower temperatures.
3 During periods of lower global temperatures snow and rain from that evaporated water tends to be higher in oxygen16 and the seawater left behind tends to be higher in oxygen18.

1 The other major method of producing O2 gas involves passing a stream of clean dry air through one bed of a pair of identical zeolite molecular sieves which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a gas stream that is 90 to 93 O2.
2 Simultaneously nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogensaturated zeolite bed by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it in the reverse direction of flow.
3 After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline.

1 Oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving.
2 Prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an O2 partial pressure more than 60 kPa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis.
3 Exposure to a O2 partial pressures greater than 160 kPa about 16 atm may lead to convulsions normally fatal for divers.
4 Acute oxygen toxicity causing seizures its most feared effect for divers can occur by breathing an air mixture with 21 O2 at 66 m or more of depth the same thing can occur by breathing 100 O2 at only 6 m.

1 Oxygen gas O2 can be toxic at elevated partial pressures leading to convulsions and other health problems.
2 j Oxygen toxicity usually begins to occur at partial pressures more than 50 kilopascals kPa equal to about 50 oxygen composition at standard pressure or 25 times the normal sealevel O2 partial pressure of about 21 kPa.
3 This is not a problem except for patients on mechanical ventilators since gas supplied through oxygen masks in medical applications is typically composed of only 30–50 O2 by volume about 30 kPa at standard pressure.

1 The 1973 oil crisis began in October 1973 when the members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries OAPEC consisting of the Arab members of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria proclaimed an oil embargo.
2 By the end of the embargo in March 1974 the price of oil had risen from US3 per barrel to nearly 12 globally US prices were significantly higher.
3 The embargo caused an oil crisis or shock with many short and longterm effects on global politics and the global economy.
4 It was later called the first oil shock followed by the 1979 oil crisis termed the second oil shock.
5 When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?	October 1973	1
6 What was the price of oil in March of 1974?	nearly 12	2
7 When was the second oil crisis?	1979	4
8 What was another term used for the oil crisis?	first oil shock	4
9 Who proclaimed the oil embargo?	members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries	1
1 The crisis had a major impact on international relations and created a rift within NATO.
2 Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott.
3 Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents.
4 To address this the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants.
5 They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights.
6 By January 18 1974 US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula.
7 The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974.
8 Why did the European nations and Japan separated themselves from United States during the crisis?	to avoid being targeted by the boycott	2
9 How did the Nixon administration negotiate with the uncooperative countries?	They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights	5
10 On what date did Henry Kissinger negotiate an Israeli troop withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula?	January 18  1974 	6
11 When did the Arab oil producers lift the embargo?	March 1974	7
1 On August 15 1971 the United States unilaterally pulled out of the Bretton Woods Accord.
2 The US abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar whose value was left to float rise and fall according to market demand.
3 Shortly thereafter Britain followed floating the pound sterling.
4 The other industrialized nations followed suit with their respective currencies.
5 Anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time the industrialized nations increased their reserves by expanding their money supplies in amounts far greater than before.
6 The result was a depreciation of the dollar and other industrialized nations currencies.
7 Because oil was priced in dollars oil producers real income decreased.
8 In September 1971 OPEC issued a joint communiqué stating that from then on they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold.
9 When did the United States withdraw from the Bretton Woods Accord?	On August 15  1971	1

11 Why was there a depreciation of the industrialized nations dollars?	industrialized nations increased their reserves	5
12 When did oil start getting priced in the terms of gold?	In September 1971	8
13 Why did oil start getting priced in terms of gold?	oil was priced in dollars  oil producers real income decreased	7
1 This contributed to the Oil Shock.
2 After 1971 OPEC was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation.
3 From 1947 to 1967 the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year.
4 Until the oil shock the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities.
5 OPEC ministers had not developed institutional mechanisms to update prices in sync with changing market conditions so their real incomes lagged.
6 The substantial price increases of 1973–1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to Bretton Woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold.
7 From 1947 to 1967 how much did the price of oil increase?	risen by less than two percent per year	3
8 When did OPEC start to readjust oil prices?	After 1971	2
9 When did oil finally returned to its Bretton Woods levels?	1973–1974	6
10 The price of oil is usually a stable commodity until when?	Until the oil shock	4
1 On October 6 1973 Syria and Egypt with support from other Arab nations launched a surprise attack on Israel on Yom Kippur.
2 This renewal of hostilities in the Arab–Israeli conflict released the underlying economic pressure on oil prices.
3 At the time Iran was the worlds secondlargest oil exporter and a close US ally.
4 Weeks later the Shah of Iran said in an interview Of course the price of oil is going to rise.
5 Certainly.
6 And how.
7 Youve Western nations increased the price of the wheat you sell us by 300 percent and the same for sugar and cement You buy our crude oil and sell it back to us refined as petrochemicals at a hundred times the price youve paid us.
8 Its only fair that from now on you should pay more for oil.
9 Lets say ten times more.

1 In response to American aid to Israel on October 16 1973 OPEC raised the posted price of oil by 70 to 511 a barrel.
2 The following day oil ministers agreed to the embargo a cut in production by five percent from Septembers output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met.
3 On October 19 Nixon requested Congress to appropriate 22 billion in emergency aid to Israel including 15 billion in outright grants.
4 George Lenczowski notes Military supplies did not exhaust Nixons eagerness to prevent Israels collapseThis 22 billion decision triggered a collective OPEC response.
5 Libya immediately announced it would embargo oil shipments to the United States.
6 Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oilproducing states joined the embargo on October 20 1973.
7 At their Kuwait meeting OAPEC proclaimed the embargo that curbed exports to various countries and blocked all oil deliveries to the US as a principal hostile country.
8 Why did OPEC raise the price of oil to 511?	In response to American aid to Israel	1

1 Some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities amid shrinking Western demand.
2 Much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions particularly in the Middle East.
3 Saudi Arabia spent over 100 billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of Islam known as Wahhabism throughout the world via religious charities such alHaramain Foundation which often also distributed funds to violent Sunni extremist groups such as AlQaeda and the Taliban.

1 In the United States scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973.
2 The possibility that the Middle East could become another superpower confrontation with the USSR was of more concern to the US than oil.
3 Further interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for Kissingers dominance.

1 The embargo had a negative influence on the US economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to US energy security.
2 On an international level the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries such as automobiles.
3 Macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts.
4 The embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies even in rugged terrain such as the Arctic.

1 The embargo was not uniform across Europe.
2 Of the nine members of the European Economic Community EEC the Netherlands faced a complete embargo the UK and France received almost uninterrupted supplies having refused to allow America to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the Arabs and the Israelis while the other six faced partial cutbacks.
3 The UK had traditionally been an ally of Israel and Harold Wilsons government supported the Israelis during the SixDay War.
4 His successor Ted Heath reversed this policy in 1970 calling for Israel to withdraw to its pre1967 borders.

1 Despite being relatively unaffected by the embargo the UK nonetheless faced an oil crisis of its own  a series of strikes by coal miners and railroad workers over the winter of 1973–74 became a major factor in the change of government.
2 Heath asked the British to heat only one room in their houses over the winter.
3 The UK Germany Italy Switzerland and Norway banned flying driving and boating on Sundays.
4 Sweden rationed gasoline and heating oil.

1 Price controls exacerbated the crisis in the US.
2 The system limited the price of old oil that which had already been discovered while allowing newly discovered oil to be sold at a higher price to encourage investment.
3 Predictably old oil was withdrawn from the market creating greater scarcity.
4 The rule also discouraged development of alternative energies.
5 The rule had been intended to promote oil exploration.

1 In 1973 Nixon named William E Simon as the first Administrator of the Federal Energy Office a shortterm organization created to coordinate the response to the embargo.
2 Simon allocated states the same amount of domestic oil for 1974 that each had consumed in 1972 which worked for states whose populations were not increasing.
3 In other states lines at gasoline stations were common.

1 The energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels.
2 There is criticism that American energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisismentality thinking promoting expensive quick fixes and singleshot solutions that ignore market and technology realities.
3 Instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient but whose prospects are doubtful.
4 What was the catalyst that created greater interest in renewable resources?	energy crisis	1
5 There is criticism that the energy policies are expensive quick fixes that ignore which facts?	market and technology realities	2
6 Who backed policies that have solutions that sound good but have poor prospects?	congresses and presidents	3
1 In 2004 declassified documents revealed that the US was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by underdeveloped countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize Middle Eastern oilfields in late 1973.
2 Although no explicit plan was mentioned a conversation between US Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Cromer revealed Schlesinger had told him that it was no longer obvious to him that the US could not use force.
3 British Prime Minister Edward Heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a British intelligence estimate of US intentions which concluded America might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the US and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and possibly Abu Dhabi in military action was decided upon.
4 Although the Soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force intelligence warned the American occupation would need to last 10 years as the West developed alternative energy sources and would result in the ‘total alienation’ of the Arabs and much of the rest of the Third World.
5 Which country was thinking about going to war to forcibly take Middle Eastern oil fields?	US	1
6 Which country was worried that the US would invade the Middle East?	British Prime Minister Edward Heath	3

1 Although lacking historical connections to the Middle East Japan was the country most dependent on Arab oil.
2 71 of its imported oil came from the Middle East in 1970.
3 On November 7 1973 the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments declared Japan a nonfriendly country to encourage it to change its noninvolvement policy.
4 It received a 5 production cut in December causing a panic.
5 On November 22 Japan issued a statement asserting that Israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories advocating Palestinian selfdetermination and threatening to reconsider its policy toward Israel if Israel refused to accept these preconditions.
6 By December 25 Japan was considered an Arabfriendly state.

1 The USSRs invasion of Afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region also marked by increased American weapons sales technology and outright military presence.
2 Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues.
3 Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries.
4 By 1979 Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israels.
5 Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran a nonArabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
6 Saudi Arabia on the other hand is an Arab largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy.
7 In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich AlHasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year.
8 In November 2010 Wikileaks leaked confidential diplomatic cables pertaining to the United States and its allies which revealed that the late Saudi King Abdullah urged the United States to attack Iran in order to destroy its potential nuclear weapons program describing Iran as a snake whose head should be cut off without any procrastination.

2 The Dodge Omni  Plymouth Horizon from Chrysler the Ford Fiesta and the Chevrolet Chevette all had fourcylinder engines and room for at least four passengers by the late 1970s.
3 By 1985 the average American vehicle moved 174 miles per gallon compared to 135 in 1970.
4 The improvements stayed even though the price of a barrel of oil remained constant at 12 from 1974 to 1979.
5 Sales of large sedans for most makes except Chrysler products recovered within two model years of the 1973 crisis.
6 The Cadillac DeVille and Fleetwood Buick Electra Oldsmobile 98 Lincoln Continental Mercury Marquis and various other luxury oriented sedans became popular again in the mid1970s.

1 OPEC soon lost its preeminent position and in 1981 its production was surpassed by that of other countries.
2 Additionally its own member nations were divided.
3 Saudi Arabia trying to recover market share increased production pushing prices down shrinking or eliminating profits for highcost producers.
4 The world price which had peaked during the 1979 energy crisis at nearly 40 per barrel decreased during the 1980s to less than 10 per barrel.
5 Adjusted for inflation oil briefly fell back to pre1973 levels.
6 This sale price was a windfall for oilimporting nations both developing and developed.

2 After the first landing sufficient flight hardware remained for nine followon landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration.
3 Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these.
4 Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings but the Apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon which disabled the command spacecrafts propulsion and life support.

1 Apollo set several major human spaceflight milestones.
2 It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low Earth orbit.
3 Apollo 8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body while the final Apollo 17 mission marked the sixth Moon landing and the ninth manned mission beyond low Earth orbit.
4 The program returned 842 pounds 382 kg of lunar rocks and soil to Earth greatly contributing to the understanding of the Moons composition and geological history.
5 The program laid the foundation for NASAs current human spaceflight capability and funded construction of its Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center.
6 Apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight including avionics telecommunications and computers.

1 The Apollo program was conceived during the Eisenhower administration in early 1960 as a followup to Project Mercury.
2 While the Mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited Earth orbital mission Apollo would carry three astronauts.
3 Possible missions included ferrying crews to a space station circumlunar flights and eventual manned lunar landings.
4 The program was named after the Greek god of light music and the sun by NASA manager Abe Silverstein who later said that I was naming the spacecraft like Id name my baby.
5 Silverstein chose the name at home one evening early in 1960 because he felt Apollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program.
6 How many people could the Mercury capsule hold?	one	2
7 How many people could Apollo be projected to hold?	three	2
8 Who named the Apollo missions?	Abe Silverstein	4
9 What was the eventual final goal of the Apollo projects?	manned lunar landings	3

1 In November 1960 John F Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the Soviet Union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense.
2 Up to the election of 1960 Kennedy had been speaking out against the missile gap that he and many other senators felt had formed between the Soviets and themselves due to the inaction of President Eisenhower.
3 Beyond military power Kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige pledging to make the US not first but first and first if but first period.
4 Despite Kennedys rhetoric he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the Apollo program once he became president.
5 He knew little about the technical details of the space program and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned Moon landing.
6 When Kennedys newly appointed NASA Administrator James E Webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASAs large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.
7 Who was elected President in November 1960?	John F Kennedy	1
8 Against what country was Kennedy promising superiority over?	Soviet Union	1

1 On April 12 1961 Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to fly in space reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union.
2 At a meeting of the US House Committee on Science and Astronautics one day after Gagarins flight many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that America would catch up.
3 Kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news refusing to make a commitment on Americas response to the Soviets.

1 On April 20 Kennedy sent a memo to Vice President Lyndon B Johnson asking Johnson to look into the status of Americas space program and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up.
2 Johnson responded approximately one week later concluding that we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership.
3 His memo concluded that a manned Moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the United States would achieve it first.
4 What month and day did Kennedy message his vice president about the status of the program?	April 20	1
5 Who was Kennedys vice president?	Lyndon B Johnson	1

7 What was the general consensus Johnson came to regarding Americas progress on going to space and reaching a position of leadership?	neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary	2
1 It became clear that managing the Apollo program would exceed the capabilities of Robert R Gilruths Space Task Group which had been directing the nations manned space program from NASAs Langley Research Center.
2 So Gilruth was given authority to grow his organization into a new NASA center the Manned Spacecraft Center MSC.
3 A site was chosen in Houston Texas on land donated by Rice University and Administrator Webb announced the conversion on September 19 1961.
4 It was also clear NASA would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its Cape Canaveral Air Force Station launch facilities in Florida so a new Mission Control Center would be included in the MSC.
5 Who originally led the Space Task Group?	Robert R Gilruth	1
6 Where was the Space Task Group located?	NASAs Langley Research Center	1
7 Where was the Manned Spacecraft Center located?	Houston  Texas	3
8 What university donated the land for the Manned Spacecraft Center?	Rice University	3
9 In what state were the original launching facilities for missions?	Florida	4
1 It also became clear that Apollo would outgrow the Canaveral launch facilities in Florida.
2 The two newest launch complexes were already being built for the Saturn I and IB rockets at the northernmost end LC34 and LC37.
3 But an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission so land acquisition was started in July 1961 for a Launch Operations Center LOC immediately north of Canaveral at Merritt Island.
4 The design development and construction of the center was conducted by Kurt H Debus a member of Dr Wernher von Brauns original V2 rocket engineering team.
5 Debus was named the LOCs first Director.
6 Construction began in November 1962.
7 Upon Kennedys death President Johnson issued an executive order on November 29 1963 to rename the LOC and Cape Canaveral in honor of Kennedy.
8 Where would the Launch Operations Center be located as more land was needed for a bigger rocket?	Merritt Island	3
9 Who conducted the construction of the new center?	Kurt H Debus	4
10 Kurt H Debus was appointed what position for the Launch Operations Center?	Director	5
11 President Johnson issued an executive order to rename the Launch Operations Center after whom?	Kennedy	7
1 The LOC included Launch Complex 39 a Launch Control Center and a 130 million cubic foot 37 million cubic meter Vertical Assembly Building VAB in which the space vehicle launch vehicle and spacecraft would be assembled on a Mobile Launcher Platform and then moved by a transporter to one of several launch pads.
2 Although at least three pads were planned only two designated A and B were completed in October 1965.
3 The LOC also included an Operations and Checkout Building OCB to which Gemini and Apollo spacecraft were initially received prior to being mated to their launch vehicles.
4 The Apollo spacecraft could be tested in two vacuum chambers capable of simulating atmospheric pressure at altitudes up to 250000 feet 76 km which is nearly a vacuum.
5 How many launch pads were originally planned?	three	2
6 What spacecraft was tested in two vacuum chambers to simulate atmospheric pressure?	Apollo spacecraft	4
7 How high in altitude in feet could the vacuum chambers simulate?	250 000 feet	4
8 How big was the Vertical Assembly Building?	130 million cubic foot	1
1 Administrator Webb realized that in order to keep Apollo costs under control he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization so he recruited Dr George E Mueller for a high management job.
2 Mueller accepted on the condition that he have a say in NASA reorganization necessary to effectively administer Apollo.
3 Webb then worked with Associate Administrator later Deputy Administrator Robert Seamans to reorganize the Office of Manned Space Flight OMSF.
4 On July 23 1963 Webb announced Muellers appointment as Deputy Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight to replace then Associate Administrator D Brainerd Holmes on his retirement effective September 1.
5 Under Webbs reorganization the directors of the Manned Spacecraft Center Gilruth Marshall Space Flight Center von Braun and the Launch Operations Center Debus effectively reported to Mueller.
6 Who did Webb recruit for better project management?	Dr George E Mueller	1
7 When was Mueller announced and appointed as Deputy Associate Administrator?	July 23  1963	4
8 Who was Mueller replaced as Associate Administrator?	D Brainerd Holmes	4
9 The administrators and directors Gilruth von Braun and Debus reported to who?	Mueller	5
1 Based on his industry experience on Air Force missile projects Mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among highranking officers in the United States Air Force so he got Webbs permission to recruit General Samuel C Phillips who gained a reputation for his effective management of the Minuteman program as OMSF program controller.
2 Phillips superior officer Bernard A Schriever agreed to loan Phillips to NASA along with a staff of officers under him on the condition that Phillips be made Apollo Program Director.

8 What was Phillips official title for NASA?	Apollo Program Director	2
1 In early 1961 direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at NASA.
2 Many engineers feared that a rendezvous —let alone a docking— neither of which had been attempted even in Earth orbit would be extremely difficult in lunar orbit.
3 Dissenters including John Houbolt at Langley Research Center emphasized the important weight reductions that were offered by the LOR approach.
4 Throughout 1960 and 1961 Houbolt campaigned for the recognition of LOR as a viable and practical option.
5 Bypassing the NASA hierarchy he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to Associate Administrator Robert Seamans while acknowledging that he spoke somewhat as a voice in the wilderness Houbolt pleaded that LOR should not be discounted in studies of the question.
6 What did the engineers fear would be difficult in space due to it never being attempted in Earth orbit?	a rendezvous —let alone a docking	2
7 In what year was direct ascent the primary mission focus at NASA?	1961	1
8 Who was the Associate Administrator that Houbolt spoke with?	Robert Seamans	5
1  Seamans establishment of an adhoc committee headed by his special technical assistant Nicholas E Golovin in July 1961 to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the Apollo program represented a turning point in NASAs mission mode decision.
2 This committee recognized that the chosen mode was an important part of the launch vehicle choice and recommended in favor of a hybrid EORLOR mode.
3 Its consideration of LOR —as well as Houbolts ceaseless work— played an important role in publicizing the workability of the approach.
4 In late 1961 and early 1962 members of the Manned Spacecraft Center began to come around to support LOR including the newly hired deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight Joseph Shea who became a champion of LOR.
5 The engineers at Marshall Space Flight Center MSFC took longer to become convinced of its merits but their conversion was announced by Wernher von Braun at a briefing in June 1962.
6 Who led the committee established by Seaman?	Nicholas E Golovin	1
7 When was this committee by Seaman established?	July 1961	1
8 Which NASA faction came around first to support the LOR?	Manned Spacecraft Center	4
9 Who was hired to be the deputy director of the Office of Manned Space Flight?	Joseph Shea	4
10 Which NASA location came around last to the idea of the LOR?	Marshall Space Flight Center	5
1 But even after NASA reached internal agreement it was far from smooth sailing.
2 Kennedys science advisor Jerome Wiesner who had expressed his opposition to manned spaceflight to Kennedy before the President took office and had opposed the decision to land men on the Moon hired Golovin who had left NASA to chair his own Space Vehicle Panel ostensibly to monitor but actually to secondguess NASAs decisions on the Saturn V launch vehicle and LOR by forcing Shea Seamans and even Webb to defend themselves delaying its formal announcement to the press on July 11 1962 and forcing Webb to still hedge the decision as tentative.
3 Who was Kennedys science adviser that opposed manned spacecraft flights?	Jerome Wiesner	2
4 Who did Wiesner hire to monitor and second guess NASAs decisions?	Golovin	2
5 Where did Golovin work prior to joining the Space Vehicle Panel?	NASA	2
6 When was the announcement for the LOR made after being delayed?	July 11  1962	2
1 Wiesner kept up the pressure even making the disagreement public during a twoday September visit by the President to Marshall Space Flight Center.
2 Wiesner blurted out No thats no good in front of the press during a presentation by von Braun.
3 Webb jumped in and defended von Braun until Kennedy ended the squabble by stating that the matter was still subject to final review.
4 Webb held firm and issued a request for proposal to candidate Lunar Excursion Module LEM contractors.
5 Wiesner finally relented unwilling to settle the dispute once and for all in Kennedys office because of the Presidents involvement with the October Cuban missile crisis and fear of Kennedys support for Webb.
6 NASA announced the selection of Grumman as the LEM contractor in November 1962.
7 Who was keeping pressure and showing disagreements for the LOR even in front of the President?	Wiesner	1

10 Who was announced as the LEM contractor in November 1962?	Grumman	6
1 The LOR method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a lifeboat in the event of a failure of the command ship.
2 Some documents prove this theory was discussed before and after the method was chosen.
3 A 1964 MSC study concluded The LM as lifeboat  was finally dropped because no single reasonable CSM failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the SPS.
4 Ironically just such a failure happened on Apollo 13 when an oxygen tank explosion left the command ship without electrical power.
5 The Lunar Module provided propulsion electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely.
6 What was the advantage that the LOR method produced in the event of a spacecraft failure?	spacecraft to be used as a lifeboat	1
7 What Apollo mission was this LOR method used and needed?	Apollo 13	4
8 What did the Lunar Module provide to help get the Apollo 13 home safely?	propulsion  electrical power and life support	5
9 In what year was the Lunar Module LM dropped because it wasnt seen as useful?	1964	3
1 Maxime Fagets preliminary Apollo design employed a coneshaped command module supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power sized appropriately for the space station cislunar and lunar landing missions.
2 Once Kennedys Moon landing goal became official detailed design began of a CommandService Module CSM in which the crew would spend the entire directascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip after being softlanded by a larger landing propulsion module.
3 The final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the CSMs role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew along with a new spacecraft the Lunar Excursion Module LEM later shortened to Lunar Module LM which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the CSM.
4 What was the shape that Faget designed for the Apollo command module?	coneshaped	1
5 What does the acronym CSM stand for?	CommandService Module	2
6 How many men would the LM take to the lunar surface and return to the CSM?	two	3
1 The Command Module CM was the conical crew cabin designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an Earth ocean landing.
2 It was the only component of the Apollo spacecraft to survive without major configuration changes as the program evolved from the early Apollo study designs.
3 Its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield and had its own reaction control system RCS engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path.
4 Parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown.
5 The module was 1142 feet 348 m tall 1283 feet 391 m in diameter and weighed approximately 12250 pounds 5560 kg.
6 How many people was the CM designed to carry in the end?	three	1

10 How much did the CM weigh in kgs?	5 560 kg	5
1 A cylindrical Service Module SM supported the Command Module with a service propulsion engine and an RCS with propellants and a fuel cell power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants.
2 A highgain Sband antenna was used for longdistance communications on the lunar flights.
3 On the extended lunar missions an orbital scientific instrument package was carried.
4 The Service Module was discarded just before reentry.
5 The module was 246 feet 75 m long and 1283 feet 391 m in diameter.

11 What was carried on extended lunar missions?	orbital scientific instrument package	3
1 North American Aviation won the contract to build the CSM and also the second stage of the Saturn V launch vehicle for NASA.
2 Because the CSM design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the CSM off of the Moon and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight.
3 Also there was no provision for docking with the Lunar Module.
4 A 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as Block I which would be used for early testing while Block II the actual lunar spacecraft would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in Block I development.
5 Who was rewarded with building the CSM?	North American Aviation	1
6 How much thrust was estimated for the translunar flight?	twice the thrust	2
7 In what year was a program study done on the modules labeled as Block I and Block II?	1964	4
8 What was the name of the launch vehicle for NASA which North American Aviation designed the second stage of?	Saturn V	1
1 The Lunar Module LM was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the Moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the Command Module.
2 Not designed to fly through the Earths atmosphere or return to Earth its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations and was of an extremely lightweight construction.
3 It consisted of separate descent and ascent stages each with its own engine.
4 The descent stage contained storage for the descent propellant surface stay consumables and surface exploration equipment.
5 The ascent stage contained the crew cabin ascent propellant and a reaction control system.
6 The initial LM model weighed approximately 33300 pounds 15100 kg and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours.
7 An Extended Lunar Module weighed over 36200 pounds 16400 kg and allowed surface stays of over 3 days.
8 How many astronauts was the LM intended to take from orbit of the moon to the surface of the moon?	two	1
9 Was the LM intended to return to Earth at all?	Not	2
10 The initial LM weighed how much in kgs?	15 100 kg	6
11 For about how long would the extended LM allow a surface stay on the moon?	3 days	7
1 Before the Apollo program began Wernher von Braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles the Saturn series and the even larger Nova series.
2 In the midst of these plans von Braun was transferred from the Army to NASA and made Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center.
3 The initial direct ascent plan to send the threeman Apollo CommandService Module directly to the lunar surface on top of a large descent rocket stage would require a Novaclass launcher with a lunar payload capability of over 180000 pounds 82000 kg.
4 The June 11 1962 decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the Saturn V to replace the Nova and the MSFC proceeded to develop the Saturn rocket family for Apollo.
5 Who had worked on the Saturn series even before the Apollo program began officially?	Wernher von Braun	1
6 From where was von Braun transferred to go to NASA?	Army	2
7 When was the decision made to replace the Nova rockets with the Saturn V?	June 11  1962	4
1 The first four Saturn I test flights were launched from LC34 with only live first stages carrying dummy upper stages filled with water.
2 The first flight with a live SIV was launched from LC37.
3 This was followed by five launches of boilerplate CSMs designated AS101 through AS105 into orbit in 1964 and 1965.

1 The problems with North American were severe enough in late 1965 to cause Manned Space Flight Administrator George Mueller to appoint program director Samuel Phillips to head a tiger team to investigate North Americans problems and identify corrections.
2 Phillips documented his findings in a December 19 letter to NAA president Lee Atwood with a strongly worded letter by Mueller and also gave a presentation of the results to Mueller and Deputy Administrator Robert Seamans.
3 Meanwhile Grumman was also encountering problems with the Lunar Module eliminating hopes it would be ready for manned flight in 1967 not long after the first manned CSM flights.
4 Who was appointed to head a team to find the problems North America had regarding manned space flight?	Samuel Phillips	1

1 Grissom White and Chaffee decided to name their flight Apollo 1 as a motivational focus on the first manned flight.
2 They trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at North American and in the altitude chamber at the Kennedy Space Center.
3 A plugsout test was planned for January which would simulate a launch countdown on LC34 with the spacecraft transferring from padsupplied to internal power.
4 If successful this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the February 21 launch with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled.
5 Where did Apollo 1s crew conduct tests at Kennedy Space Center?	altitude chamber	2
6 Who was the main crew of Apollo 1 of which they named themselves?	Grissom  White  and Chaffee	1
7 What was a plugsout test done to simulate on the LC34?	launch countdown	3
8 What other location did Apollo 1 test at besides Kennedy Space Center?	North American	2
1 The plugsout test began on the morning of January 27 1967 and immediately was plagued with problems.
2 First the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits which delayed the sealing of the hatch.
3 Then communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown.
4 During this hold an electrical fire began in the cabin and spread quickly in the high pressure 100 oxygen atmosphere.
5 Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin burst and the fire erupted onto the pad area frustrating attempts to rescue the crew.
6 The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened.

1 NASA immediately convened an accident review board overseen by both houses of Congress.
2 While the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex the review board concluded that deficiencies existed in Command Module design workmanship and quality control.
3 At the insistence of NASA Administrator Webb North American removed Harrison Storms as Command Module program manager.
4 Webb also reassigned Apollo Spacecraft Program Office ASPO Manager Joseph Francis Shea replacing him with George Low.
5 Who kept tabs on the accident review board that NASA created?	both houses of Congress	1
6 What was found to be at fault for the fire in the cabin on Apollo 1 regarding the CM design?	deficiencies	2
7 Who ended up replacing Joseph Francis Shea as ASPO Manager?	George Low	4
8 How soon after the cabin fire incident did NASA create its accident review board?	immediately	1
1 To remedy the causes of the fire changes were made in the Block II spacecraft and operational procedures the most important of which were use of a nitrogenoxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials.
2 The Block II design already called for replacement of the Block I plugtype hatch cover with a quickrelease outward opening door.
3 NASA discontinued the manned Block I program using the Block I spacecraft only for unmanned Saturn V flights.
4 Crew members would also exclusively wear modified fireresistant Block II space suits and would be designated by the Block II titles regardless of whether a LM was present on the flight or not.
5 What type of mixture was created to replace the pure oxygen atmosphere inside the cabin?	nitrogenoxygen mixture	1
6 What type of materials inside the cabin were removed to help prevent more fire hazards in the future?	flammable cabin and space suit materials	1
7 The door on the Block II design was eventually replaced with what kind of model?	quickrelease  outward opening door	2
8 What eventually happened to the Block I program after the incident?	discontinued	3
9 Crew members were required to wear what type of space suit during testing after the incident?	fireresistant Block II	4
1 In September 1967 Mueller approved a sequence of mission types which had to be successfully accomplished in order to achieve the manned lunar landing.
2 Each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary therefore letters were used instead of numbers.
3 The A missions were unmanned Saturn V validation B was unmanned LM validation using the Saturn IB C was manned CSM Earth orbit validation using the Saturn IB D was the first manned CSMLM flight this replaced AS258 using a single Saturn V launch E would be a higher Earth orbit CSMLM flight F would be the first lunar mission testing the LM in lunar orbit but without landing a dress rehearsal and G would be the first manned landing.
4 The list of types covered followon lunar exploration to include H lunar landings I for lunar orbital survey missions and J for extendedstay lunar landings.
5 What type of missions were approved by Mueller after the incident?	sequence	1
6 What had to happen to each mission before they would continue on to the next mission?	successful	2
7 Since NASA didnt know how many attempts each test would end up requiring what did they use instead of numbers for the trials?	letters	2
1 The delay in the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA to catch up on manrating the LM and Saturn V Apollo 4 AS501 was the first unmanned flight of the Saturn V carrying a Block I CSM on November 9 1967.
2 The capability of the Command Modules heat shield to survive a translunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earthorbital reentry speed.
3 This was followed on April 4 1968 by Apollo 6 AS502 which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast.
4 The intent of this mission was to achieve translunar injection followed closely by a simulated directreturn abort using the Service Module engine to achieve another highspeed reentry.
5 The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation a problem caused by nonsteady engine combustion which damaged fuel lines in the second and third stages.
6 Two SII engines shut down prematurely but the remaining engines were able to compensate.
7 The damage to the third stage engine was more severe preventing it from restarting for translunar injection.
8 Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4.
9 Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems NASA declared the Saturn V ready to fly men cancelling a third unmanned test.
10 What was the technical name of the first unmanned Saturn V flight Apollo 4?	AS501	1
11 What was one thing that was specifically tested on the Apollo 4 test launch regarding the CM?	heat shield	2

13 What was cancelled by NASA after the Apollo 6 testing after deeming the Saturn V ready to hold men?	third unmanned test	9
1 Apollo 5 AS204 was the first unmanned test flight of LM in Earth orbit launched from pad 37 on January 22 1968 by the Saturn IB that would have been used for Apollo 1.
2 The LM engines were successfully testfired and restarted despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing.
3 The ascent engine was fired in abort mode known as a fireinthehole test where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage.
4 Although Grumman wanted a second unmanned test George Low decided the next LM flight would be manned.

1 Apollo 8 was planned to be the D mission in December 1968 crewed by McDivitt Scott and Schweickart launched on a Saturn V instead of two Saturn IBs.
2 In the summer it had become clear that the LM would not be ready in time.
3 Rather than waste the Saturn V on another simple Earthorbiting mission ASPO Manager George Low suggested the bold step of sending Apollo 8 to orbit the Moon instead deferring the D mission to the next mission in March 1969 and eliminating the E mission.
4 This would keep the program on track.
5 The Soviet Union had sent animals around the Moon on September 15 1968 aboard Zond 5 and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts.
6 The decision was not announced publicly until successful completion of Apollo 7.
7 Gemini veterans Frank Borman and James Lovell and rookie William Anders captured the worlds attention by making 10 lunar orbits in 20 hours transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on Christmas Eve and returning safely to Earth.

1 The contracted batch of 15 Saturn Vs were enough for lunar landing missions through Apollo 20.
2 NASA publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites with plans to increase the mass of the CSM and LM for the last five missions along with the payload capacity of the Saturn V These final missions would combine the I and J types in the 1967 list allowing the CMP to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface and allowing them to stay on the Moon for over three days.
3 These missions would also carry the Lunar Roving Vehicle LRV increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the LM.
4 Also the Block II spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the LRV.
5 What would the latter Apollo missions carry to the moon to increase exploration?	Lunar Roving Vehicle LRV	3
6 What was redesigned to allow better maneuverability in the LRV?	Block II spacesuit	4

9 What would have to be increased regarding the LM and CSM for the last five missions?	mass	2
1 The success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as Commander with two rookies.
2 Apollo 13 launched Lovell Jack Swigert and Fred Haise in April 1970 headed for the Fra Mauro formation.
3 But two days out a liquid oxygen tank exploded disabling the Service Module and forcing the crew to use the LM as a life boat to return to Earth.
4 Another NASA review board was convened to determine the cause which turned out to be a combination of damage of the tank in the factory and a subcontractor not making a tank component according to updated design specifications.
5 Apollo was grounded again for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added.
6 What happened to the Apollo 13 crew to force them to use the LM as a life boat as it had been designed?	liquid oxygen tank exploded	3

9 What was redesigned during the Apollo program being grounded during 1970?	oxygen tank	5
10 What month and year was Apollo 13 launched?	April 1970	2
1 About the time of the first landing in 1969 it was decided to use an existing Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory prebuilt on the ground replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches this eliminated Apollo 20.
2 NASAs yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle.
3 By 1971 the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19.
4 The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island Florida George C Marshall Space Center in Huntsville Alabama Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans Louisiana and Lyndon B Johnson Space Center in Houston Texas.

1 The rocks collected from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth as measured by radiometric dating techniques.
2 They range in age from about 32 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria to about 46 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust.
3 As such they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the Solar System that are largely absent on Earth.
4 One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the Genesis Rock retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission.
5 This anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calciumrich feldspar mineral anorthite and is believed to be representative of the highland crust.
6 A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered which has no known terrestrial counterpart.

1 Looking beyond the manned lunar landings NASA investigated several postlunar applications for Apollo hardware.
2 The Apollo Extension Series Apollo X proposed up to 30 flights to Earth orbit using the space in the Spacecraft Lunar Module Adapter SLA to house a small orbital laboratory workshop.
3 Astronauts would continue to use the CSM as a ferry to the station.
4 This study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty SIVB Saturn upper stage and grew into the Apollo Applications Program AAP.
5 The workshop was to be supplemented by Apollo Telescope Missions which would replace the LMs descent stage equipment and engine with a solar telescope observatory.
6 The most ambitious plan called for using an empty SIVB as an interplanetary spacecraft for a Venus flyby mission.
7 What did NASA name the series seeking up to 30 more flights to Earths orbit?	Apollo X	2
8 What did the acronym AAP stand for?	Apollo Applications Program	4

1 The Moon landing data was recorded by a special Apollo TV camera which recorded in a format incompatible with broadcast TV.
2 This resulted in lunar footage that had to be converted for the live television broadcast and stored on magnetic telemetry tapes.
3 During the following years a magnetic tape shortage prompted NASA to remove massive numbers of magnetic tapes from the National Archives and Records Administration to be recorded over with newer satellite data.
4 Stan Lebar who led the team that designed and built the lunar television camera at Westinghouse Electric Corporation also worked with Nafzger to try to locate the missing tapes.

1 Although the European Union does not have a codified constitution like every political body it has laws which constitute its basic governance structure.
2 The EUs primary constitutional sources are the Treaty on European Union TEU and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU which have been agreed or adhered to among the governments of all 28 member states.
3 The Treaties establish the EUs institutions list their powers and responsibilities and explain the areas in which the EU can legislate with Directives or Regulations.
4 The European Commission has the initiative to propose legislation.
5 During the ordinary legislative procedure the Council which are ministers from member state governments and the European Parliament elected by citizens can make amendments and must give their consent for laws to pass.
6 The Commission oversees departments and various agencies that execute or enforce EU law.
7 The European Council rather than the Council made up of different government Ministers is composed of the Prime Ministers or executive Presidents of the member states.
8 It appoints the Commissioners and the board of the European Central Bank.
9 The European Court of Justice is the supreme judicial body which interprets EU law and develops it through precedent.
10 The Court can review the legality of the EU institutions actions in compliance with the Treaties.
11 It can also decide upon claims for breach of EU laws from member states and citizens.
12 What are the two primary constitutional sources of the European Union?	Treaty on European Union TEU and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU	2
13 Who has the power to initiate legislation within the European Union?	The European Commission	4
14 Who elects the members of the European Parliament?	citizens	5
15 What court is able to interpret European Union law?	The European Court of Justice	9
16 What governing body appoints commissioners and the board of European Central Bank?	The European Council	7
1 The primary law of the EU consists mainly of the founding treaties the core treaties being the Treaty on European Union TEU and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU.
2 The Treaties contain formal and substantive provisions which frame policies of the European Union institutions and determine the division of competences between the European Union and its member states.
3 The TEU establishes that European Union law applies to the metropolitan territories of the member states as well as certain islands and overseas territories including Madeira the Canary Islands and the French overseas departments.
4 European Union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations for example Gibraltar and the Åland islands.
5 The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions as for example done for customs matters in Gibraltar and SaintPierreetMiquelon.
6 The TEU specifically excludes certain regions for example the Faroe Islands from the jurisdiction of European Union law.
7 Treaties apply as soon as they enter into force unless stated otherwise and are generally concluded for an unlimited period.
8 The TEU provides that commitments entered into by the member states between themselves before the treaty was signed no longer apply.
9 vague All EU member states are regarded as subject to the general obligation of the principle of cooperation as stated in the TEU whereby member states are obliged not to take measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the TEU objectives.

1 The principal Treaties that form the European Union began with common rules for coal and steel and then atomic energy but more complete and formal institutions were established through the Treaty of Rome 1957 and the Maastricht Treaty 1992 now TFEU.
2 Minor amendments were made during the 1960s and 1970s.
3 Major amending treaties were signed to complete the development of a single internal market in the Single European Act 1986 to further the development of a more social Europe in the Treaty of Amsterdam 1997 and to make minor amendments to the relative power of member states in the EU institutions in the Treaty of Nice 2001 and the Treaty of Lisbon 2007.
4 Since its establishment more member states have joined through a series of accession treaties from the UK Ireland Denmark and Norway in 1972 though Norway did not end up joining Greece in 1979 Spain and Portugal 1985 Austria Finland Norway and Sweden in 1994 though again Norway failed to join because of lack of support in the referendum the Czech Republic Cyprus Estonia Hungary Latvia Lithuania Malta Poland Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004 Romania and Bulgaria in 2007 and Croatia in 2013.

1 Following the Nice Treaty there was an attempt to reform the constitutional law of the European Union and make it more transparent this would have also produced a single constitutional document.
2 However as a result of the referendum in France and the referendum in the Netherlands the 2004 Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe never came into force.
3 Instead the Lisbon Treaty was enacted.
4 Its substance was very similar to the proposed constitutional treaty but it was formally an amending treaty and – though it significantly altered the existing treaties – it did not completely replace them.

1 The European Commission is the main executive body of the European Union.
2 Article 171 of the Treaty on European Union states the Commission should promote the general interest of the Union while Article 173 adds that Commissioners should be completely independent and not take instructions from any Government.
3 Under article 172 Union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal except where the Treaties provide otherwise.
4 This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure although the Council is the de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives.
5 The Parliament can also formally request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal but the Commission can reject such a suggestion giving reasons.
6 The Commissions President currently an exLuxembourg Prime Minister JeanClaude Juncker sets the agenda for the EUs work.
7 Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote usually through a written procedure of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections.
8 citation needed Since Ireland refused to consent to changes in the Treaty of Lisbon 2007 there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states including the President and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy currently Federica Mogherini.
9 The Commissioners and most importantly the portfolios they will hold are bargained over intensively by the member states.
10 The Commissioners as a block are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve and majority approval of the Parliament.
11 The proposal to make the Commissioners be drawn from the elected Parliament was not adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon.
12 This means Commissioners are through the appointment process the unelected subordinates of member state governments.

1 Commissioners have various privileges such as being exempt from member state taxes but not EU taxes and having immunity from prosecution for doing official acts.
2 Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999 and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations.
3 This resulted in one main case Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job for which he was clearly unqualified did in fact not break any law.
4 By contrast to the ECJs relaxed approach a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had ‘even the slightest sense of responsibility’.
5 This led to the creation of the European Antifraud Office.
6 In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health John Dalli who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a €60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive.
7 Beyond the Commission the European Central Bank has relative executive autonomy in its conduct of monetary policy for the purpose of managing the euro.
8 It has a sixperson board appointed by the European Council on the Councils recommendation.
9 The President of the Council and a Commissioner can sit in on ECB meetings but do not have voting rights.

1 While the Commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process.
2 According to the Treaty on European Union articles 9 and 10 the EU observes the principle of equality of its citizens and is meant to be founded on representative democracy.
3 In practice equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commissions wishes citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in Parliament as citizens of the largest countries and qualified majorities or consensus of the Council are required to legislate.
4 The justification for this democratic deficit under the Treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the European economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts while popular understanding of the EU developed and nationalist sentiments declined postwar.
5 Over time this has meant the Parliament gradually assumed more voice from being an unelected assembly to its first direct elections in 1979 to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process.
6 Citizens rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all European member states under TEU article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the Commission with one million signatures.
7 TFEU article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the Parliament on issues which affect them.
8 Parliament elections take place every five years and votes for Members of the European Parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote.
9 There are 750 MEPs and their numbers are degressively proportional according to member state size.
10 This means  although the Council is meant to be the body representing member states  in the Parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states.
11 MEPs divide as they do in national Parliaments along political party lines the conservative European Peoples Party is currently the largest and the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition.
12 Parties do not receive public funds from the EU as the Court of Justice held in Parti écologiste Les Verts v Parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states.
13 The Parliaments powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an Ombudsman pending any court proceedings.
14 It can require the Commission respond to questions and by a twothirds majority can censure the whole Commission as happened to the Santer Commission in 1999.
15 In some cases the Parliament has explicit consultation rights which the Commission must genuinely follow.
16 However its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the Commission and Council meaning power kratia is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people demos in the EU it is not yet true that the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few.
17 Which two governing bodies have legislative veto power?	the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union	1
18 What cant Parliament do that causes equality and democracy to be deficient?	cannot initiate legislation against the Commissions wishes	3
19 How often do Parliament elections take place?	every five years	8

25 How often do Parliament elections take place?	every five years	8
26 Which party is currently the largest among political party lines?	the conservative European Peoples Party	11
1 The second main legislative body is the Council which is composed of different ministers of the member states.
2 The heads of government of member states also convene a European Council a distinct body that the TEU article 15 defines as providing the necessary impetus for its development and shall define the general political directions and priorities.
3 It meets each six months and its President currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk is meant to drive forward its work but it does not itself legislative functions.
4 The Council does this in effect this is the governments of the member states but there will be a different minister at each meeting depending on the topic discussed eg.
5 for environmental issues the member states environment ministers attend and vote for foreign affairs the foreign ministers etc.
6 The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions.
7 When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states.
8 In total there are 352 votes but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote if not consensus.
9 TEU article 164 and TFEU article 2383 define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the Council members not votes representing 65 per cent of the population of the EU currently this means around 74 per cent or 260 of the 352 votes.
10 This is critical during the legislative process.
11 The legislative body the Council are made up of what type of individuals?	different ministers of the member states	1
12 Who is currently the President of the Council?	Donald Tusk	3

1 To make new legislation TFEU article 294 defines the ordinary legislative procedure that applies for most EU acts.
2 The essence is there are three readings starting with a Commission proposal where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs not just those present to block or suggest changes and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes but by unanimity to block Commission amendment.
3 Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage a Conciliation Committee is convened representing MEPs ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text if this works it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority.
4 This means legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament a minority in the Council and a majority in the Commission it is harder to change EU law than stay the same.
5 A different procedure exists for budgets.
6 For enhanced cooperation among a subset of at least member states authorisation must be given by the Council.
7 Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure.
8 The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties.
9 TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred although there is a debate about the KompetenzKompetenz question who ultimately has the competence to define the EUs competence.
10 Many member state courts believe they decide other member state Parliaments believe they decide while within the EU the Court of Justice believes it has the final say.
11 What type of vote must the Parliament have to either block or suggest changes to the Commissions proposals?	a majority	2
12 What type of vote must the Council pass in order to approve of any changes recommended by Parliament?	qualified majority	2
13 Is it easier or harder to change EU law than stay the same?	harder	4
14 What articles state that unless conferred powers remain with member states?	TEU articles 4 and 5	9

18 Which articles state that powers stay with member states unless theyve been conferred?	TEU articles 4 and 5	9
19 What entity is created if the three different institutions cannot come to a consensus at any stage?	Conciliation Committee	3
1 The judicial branch of the EU has played an important role in the development of EU law by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties and accelerating economic and political integration.
2 Today the Court of Justice of the European Union CJEU is the main judicial body within which there is a higher European Court of Justice commonly abbreviated as ECJ that deals with cases that contain more public importance and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance.
3 There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues and then a separate Court of Auditors.
4 Under the Treaty on European Union article 192 there is one judge from each member state 28 at present who are supposed to possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices or for the General Court the ability required for appointment to high judicial office.
5 A president is elected by the judges for three years.
6 Under TEU article 193 is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law.
7 In fact most EU law is applied by member state courts the English Court of Appeal the German Bundesgerichtshof the Belgian Cour du travail etc.
8 but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling.
9 The CJEUs duty is to ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate.
10 Arguably this has been done through both seminal and controversial judgments including Van Gend en Loos Mangold v Helm and Kadi v Commission.
11 Which branch of the EU has had the most influence on the development of EU law?	judicial branch	1
12 What is the main judicial body of the EU?	Court of Justice of the European Union CJEU	2

1 Since its founding the EU has operated among an increasing plurality of national and globalising legal systems.
2 This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems.
3 Within the EU itself the Court of Justices view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law then EU law has primacy.
4 In the first major case in 1964 Costa v ENEL a Milanese lawyer and former shareholder of an energy company named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations.
5 He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267.
6 The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962 and the treaty was in force from 1958 Costa had no claim.
7 By contrast the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim not Mr Costa.
8 However in principle Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision.
9 The Court of Justice repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos said member states albeit within limited spheres have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves on the basis of reciprocity.
10 EU law would not be overridden by domestic legal provisions however framed without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.
11 This meant any subsequent unilateral act of the member state inapplicable.
12 Similarly in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA a company Simmenthal SpA claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968.
13 In accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law said the Court of Justice the directly applicable measures of the institutions such as the Regulations in the case render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law.
14 This was necessary to prevent a corresponding denial of Treaty obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states that could imperil the very foundations of the EU.
15 But despite the views of the Court of Justice the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis.
16 If there is a conflict between EU law and national law which law take precedence?	EU law	3
17 What was the reason the Italian Constitutional court gave that resulted in Mr Costa losing his his claim against ENEL?	nationalisation law was from 1962  and the treaty was in force from 1958	6
18 What were the years two Regulations that conflicted with an Italian law originate in the Simmenthal SpA case?	1964 and 1968	12
19 Which entities have had to develop principles dedicated to conflict resolution between laws of different systems?	the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts	2
20 When did Costa v ENEL take place?	1964	4
21 Which court argued that the Treaty of Rome did not prevent energy nationalism?	the Court of Justice	7
1 Generally speaking while all member states recognise that EU law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the Treaties they do not accept that the Court of Justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights.
2 In the United Kingdom the basic principle is that Parliament as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law.
3 This however would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU.
4 It was held in R Factortame Ltd v Secretary of State for Transport that whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary and so it has always been clear that UK courts have a duty to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law.
5 More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R HS2 Action Alliance Ltd v Secretary of State for Transport although the UK constitution is uncodified there could be fundamental principles of common law and Parliament did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972.
6 The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles particularly democracy the rule of law and the social state principles then it cannot override German law.
7 However as the nicknames of the judgments go so long as the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles.
8 Most other member states have expressed similar reservations.
9 This suggests the EUs legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states its factual commitment to human rights and the democratic will of the people.
10 What do all member states agree takes precedence over national law?	EU law	1
11 What issues do member states say the Court of Justice does not have the final say on?	foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights	1
12 When was the European Communities Act created?	1972	5
13 What does the EUs legitimacy rest on?	the ultimate authority of member states  its factual commitment to human rights  and the democratic will of the people	9
14 In what cases can the EU not override German law?	if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles	6
1 While constitutional law concerns the European Unions governance structure administrative law binds EU institutions and member states to follow the law.
2 Both member states and the Commission have a general legal right or standing locus standi to bring claims against EU institutions and other member states for breach of the treaties.
3 From the EUs foundation the Court of Justice also held that the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations if they were properly interpreted as creating rights and obligations.
4 However under Directives citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other nonstate parties.
5 This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted even though the member state government could be sued if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation.
6 These rules on direct effect limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law.
7 All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review and judged by standards of proportionality particularly where general principles of law or fundamental rights are engaged.
8 The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction in order to ensure the law is effective as possible.
9 Which type of law makes EU institutions and its member states follow the law?	administrative law	1
10 During what year were citizens or corporations said to not be able to bring claims against other non state parties?	1986	4
11 Which actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review?	All actions	7
12 Which type of law concerns the EUs governance structure?	constitutional law	1
1 Although it is generally accepted that EU law has primacy not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims that is not all EU laws have direct effect.
2 In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that the provisions of the Treaties and EU Regulations are directly effective if they are 1 clear and unambiguous 2 unconditional and 3 did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them.
3 Van Gend en Loos a postal company claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs when it imported ureaformaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands.
4 After a Dutch court made a reference the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not expressly confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims they could do so.
5 Historically international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement but the Court of Justice proclaimed the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law.
6 Because article 30 clearly unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade without a good justification Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff.
7 EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense because as TFEU article 288 states they are ‘directly applicable in all Member States’.
8 Moreover member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law in order to prevent confusion.
9 For instance in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows to reduce dairy overproduction and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions.
10 Regulations held the Court of Justice come into force solely by virtue of their publication and implementation could have the effect of jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union.
11 On the other hand some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures in which case those specific rules should be followed.
12 In which case was it held that the provisions of the treaties are directly effective if they are clear unconditional and dont require further action by EU or national authorities?	Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen	2
13 Which TEFU article states that no quantitative restrictions can be placed on trade?	article 30	6
14 What type of company is Van Gend en Loos?	a postal company	3
15 What are EU Regulations essentially the same as in the case mentioned?	Treaty provisions	7
1 While the Treaties and Regulations will have direct effect if clear unconditional and immediate Directives do not generally give citizens as opposed to the member state standing to sue other citizens.
2 In theory this is because TFEU article 288 says Directives are addressed to the member states and usually leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods to implement.
3 In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards leaving member states to apply higher standards.
4 For example the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year but most member states require more than 28 days in national law.
5 However on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives but not from Directives themselves.
6 Directives do not have so called horizontal direct effect ie.
7 between nonstate parties.
8 This view was instantly controversial and in the early 1990s three Advocate Generals persuasively argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens.
9 The Court of Justice refused but there are five large exceptions.
10 What generally does not allow citizens to sue other citizens?	Directives	1
11 How many paid holiday days does the Working Time directive require workers to have each year?	4 weeks	4
12 How many paid holiday days do most member states require?	28 days	4
13 When did the three Advocate Generals argue that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens?	early 1990s	8
1 First if a Directives deadline for implementation is not met the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws and a citizen may rely on the Directive in such an action so called vertical direct effect.
2 So in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73173EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Rattis solvent and varnish business.
3 A member state could not rely as against individuals on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails.
4 Second a citizen or company can invoke a Directive not just in a dispute with a public authority but in a dispute with another citizen or company.
5 So in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required.
6 Third if a Directive gives expression to a general principle of EU law it can be invoked between private nonstate parties before its deadline for implementation.
7 This follows from Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH  Co KG where the German Civil Code §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal.
8 Ms Kücükdeveci worked for 10 years from age 18 to 28 for Swedex GmbH  Co KG before her dismissal.
9 She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive.
10 The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law.
11 Third if the defendant is an emanation of the state even if not central government it can still be bound by Directives.
12 In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer British Gas plc which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65 if 1 pursuant to a state measure 2 it provided a public service and 3 had special powers.
13 This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision.
14 What happens first if a Directives deadline for implementation is not met?	the member state cannot enforce conflicting laws  and a citizen may rely on the Directive in such an action	1
15 What happens secondly if a Directives deadline is not met?	a citizen or company can invoke a Directive  not just in a dispute with a public authority  but in a dispute with another citizen or company	4
16 How long did Ms Kucukdeveci work for Swedex Gmbh  Co KG before she was dismissed?	10 years	8
17 Which company did Mrs Foster work for?	British Gas plc	12
18 At what age did British Gas plc force their workers to retire?	women retire at age 60 and men at 65	12
1 Fourth national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive.
2 Textbooks though not the Court itself often called this indirect effect.
3 In Marleasing SA v La Comercial SA the Court of Justice held that a Spanish Court had to interpret its general Civil Code provisions on contracts lacking cause or defrauding creditors to conform with the First Company Law Directive article 11 that required incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons.
4 The Court of Justice quickly acknowledged that the duty of interpretation cannot contradict plain words in a national statute.
5 But fifth if a member state has failed to implement a Directive a citizen may not be able to bring claims against other nonstate parties but can sue the member state itself for failure to implement the law.
6 So in Francovich v Italy the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent as the Insolvency Protection Directive required.
7 Francovich the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss.
8 The Court of Justice held that if a Directive would confer identifiable rights on individuals and there is a causal link between a member states violation of EU and a claimants loss damages must be paid.
9 The fact that the incompatible law is an Act of Parliament is no defence.
10 Which courts have a duty to interpret domestic law as far as possible?	national courts	1
11 What does the First Company Law Directive article 11 require?	incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons	3
12 What did the Italian government fail to do in Francovich v Italy?	failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent	6
13 How much money was Francovich allowed to claim from the Italian goverment in damages?	6 million Lira	7
1 The principles of European Union law are rules of law which have been developed by the European Court of Justice that constitute unwritten rules which are not expressly provided for in the treaties but which affect how European Union law is interpreted and applies.
2 In formulating these principles the courts have drawn on a variety of sources including public international law and legal doctrines and principles present in the legal systems of European Union member states and in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.
3 Accepted general principles of European Union Law include fundamental rights see human rights proportionality legal certainty equality before the law and subsidiarity.
4 Which entity developed the principles of European Union Law?	the European Court of Justice	1
5 What are some of the accepted general principles of European Union law?	fundamental rights see human rights  proportionality  legal certainty  equality before the law and subsidiarity	3
1 Proportionality is recognised one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1950s.
2 According to the general principle of proportionality the lawfulness of an action depends on whether it was appropriate and necessary to achieve the objectives legitimately pursued.
3 When there is a choice between several appropriate measures the least onerous must be adopted and any disadvantage caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued.
4 The principle of proportionality is also recognised in Article 5 of the EC Treaty stating that any action by the Community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this Treaty.
5 How long has Proportionality been recognized as one of the general principles of EU law?	since the 1950s	1
6 Where is the principle of proportionality recognized in the EC treaty?	in Article 5	4
7 Which measure must be adopted when there is a choice between several?	the least onerous	3
1 The concept of legal certainty is recognised one of the general principles of European Union law by the European Court of Justice since the 1960s.
2 It is an important general principle of international law and public law which predates European Union law.
3 As a general principle in European Union law it means that the law must be certain in that it is clear and precise and its legal implications foreseeable specially when applied to financial obligations.
4 The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis.
5 Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law.
6 In European Union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits Ex post facto laws ie.
7 laws should not take effect before they are published.
8 The doctrine of legitimate expectation which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law.
9 The legitimate expectation doctrine holds that and that those who act in good faith on the basis of law as it is or seems to be should not be frustrated in their expectations.
10 How long has the concept of legal certainty been recognized as one of the general principles by the EU law?	since the 1960s	1
11 Which laws mentioned predate EU law?	international law and public law	2
12 What must the adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the EU have?	a proper legal basis	4
13 In what does the doctrine of legitimate expectations have roots?	the principles of legal certainty and good faith	8
1 Fundamental rights as in human rights were first recognised by the European Court of Justice in the late 60s and fundamental rights are now regarded as integral part of the general principles of European Union law.
2 As such the European Court of Justice is bound to draw inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the member states.
3 Therefore the European Court of Justice cannot uphold measures which are incompatible with fundamental rights recognised and protected in the constitutions of member states.
4 The European Court of Justice also found that international treaties for the protection of human rights on which the member states have collaborated or of which they are signatories can supply guidelines which should be followed within the framework of Community law.
5 Where is the European Court of justice likely to get inspiration from?	from the constitutional traditions common to the member states	2
6 The European Court of Justice cannot uphold measures that are incompatible with what?	fundamental rights recognised and protected in the constitutions of member states	3
1 None of the original treaties establishing the European Union mention protection for fundamental rights.
2 It was not envisaged for European Union measures that is legislative and administrative actions by European Union institutions to be subject to human rights.
3 At the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights hence the establishment of the European Convention on Human Rights in 1950 and the establishment of the European Court of Human Rights.
4 The European Court of Justice recognised fundamental rights as general principle of European Union law as the need to ensure that European Union measures are compatible with the human rights enshrined in member states constitution became ever more apparent.
5 In 1999 the European Council set up a body tasked with drafting a European Charter of Human Rights which could form the constitutional basis for the European Union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the European Union and its institutions.
6 The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union draws a list of fundamental rights from the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms the Declaration on Fundamental Rights produced by the European Parliament in 1989 and European Union Treaties.
7 How many original treaties establishing the EU protected fundamental rights?	None	1
8 Which entities were originally concerned with preventing violation of human rights?	member states	3
9 When was the European Convention on Human Rights established?	1950	3
10 What other entity was established at the same time as the European Convention on Human Rights?	European Court of Human Rights	3
11 When did the European Council task an entity with drafting a European Charter of Human Rights?	1999	5
1 The 2007 Lisbon Treaty explicitly recognised fundamental rights by providing in Article 61 that The Union recognises the rights freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union of 7 December 2000 as adopted at Strasbourg on 12 December 2007 which shall have the same legal value as the Treaties.
2 Therefore the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has become an integral part of European Union law codifying the fundamental rights which were previously considered general principles of European Union law.
3 In effect after the Lisbon Treaty the Charter and the Convention now coexist under European Union law though the former is enforced by the European Court of Justice in relation to European Union measures and the latter by the European Court of Human Rights in relation to measures by member states.
4 When was the Lisbon Treaty established?	2007	1
5 What charter has become an important aspect of EU law?	the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union	2
6 After the Lisbon treaty the Charter and the Convention now coexist under what?	European Union law	3
7 What entity enforces the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union?	European Court of Justice	3
1 The Social Chapter is a chapter of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam covering social policy issues in European Union law.
2 The basis for the Social Chapter was developed in 1989 by the social partners representatives namely UNICE the employers confederation the European Trade Union Confederation ETUC and CEEP the European Centre of Public Enterprises.
3 A toned down version was adopted as the Social Charter at the 1989 Strasbourg European Council.
4 The Social Charter declares 30 general principles including on fair remuneration of employment health and safety at work rights of disabled and elderly the rights of workers on vocational training and improvements of living conditions.
5 The Social Charter became the basis for European Community legislation on these issues in 40 pieces of legislation.
6 The Social Chapter is a chapter of what treaty?	1997 Treaty of Amsterdam	1
7 What year was the Treaty of Amsterdam created?	1997	1
8 When was the basis for the Social Chapter developed?	1989	2
9 How many general principles does the Social Charter declare?	30	4
10 How many pieces of legislation has the Social Charter become the basis for?	40	5
1 The Social Charter was subsequently adopted in 1989 by 11 of the then 12 member states.
2 The UK refused to sign the Social Charter and was exempt from the legislation covering Social Charter issues unless it agreed to be bound by the legislation.
3 The UK subsequently was the only member state to veto the Social Charter being included as the Social Chapter of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty  instead an Agreement on Social Policy was added as a protocol.
4 Again the UK was exempt from legislation arising from the protocol unless it agreed to be bound by it.
5 The protocol was to become known as Social Chapter despite not actually being a chapter of the Maastricht Treaty.
6 To achieve aims of the Agreement on Social Policy the European Union was to support and complement the policies of member states.
7 The aims of the Agreement on Social Policy are.
8 How many member states adopted the Social Charter in 1989?	11 of the then 12 member states	1

11 What year was the Maastricht treaty signed?	1992	3
1 Following the election of the UK Labour Party to government in 1997 the UK formally subscribed to the Agreement on Social Policy which allowed it to be included with minor amendments as the Social Chapter of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam.
2 The UK subsequently adopted the main legislation previously agreed under the Agreement on Social Policy the 1994 Works Council Directive which required workforce consultation in businesses and the 1996 Parental Leave Directive.
3 In the 10 years following the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam and adoption of the Social Chapter the European Union has undertaken policy initiatives in various social policy areas including labour and industry relations equal opportunity health and safety public health protection of children the disabled and elderly poverty migrant workers education training and youth.

1 EU Competition law has its origins in the European Coal and Steel Community ECSC agreement between France Italy Belgium the Netherlands Luxembourg and Germany in 1951 following the second World War.
2 The agreement aimed to prevent Germany from reestablishing dominance in the production of coal and steel as members felt that its dominance had contributed to the outbreak of the war.
3 Article 65 of the agreement banned cartels and article 66 made provisions for concentrations or mergers and the abuse of a dominant position by companies.
4 This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the transEuropean model of competition law.
5 In 1957 competition rules were included in the Treaty of Rome also known as the EC Treaty which established the European Economic Community EEC.
6 The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted.
7 The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85 which prohibited anticompetitive agreements subject to some exemptions and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position.
8 The treaty also established principles on competition law for member states with article 90 covering public undertakings and article 92 making provisions on state aid.
9 Regulations on mergers were not included as member states could not establish consensus on the issue at the time.
10 Which countries were the European Coal and Steel Community agreement between?	France  Italy  Belgium  the Netherlands  Luxembourg and Germany	1
11 What year was the ECSC agreement established?	1951	1
12 What did article 65 of the ECSC ban?	cartels	3
13 Which article made provisions for concentrations or mergers and the abuse of a dominant position by companies?	article 66	3
14 When were competition rules included in the Treaty of Rome?	1957	5
1 Today the Treaty of Lisbon prohibits anticompetitive agreements in Article 1011 including price fixing.
2 According to Article 1012 any such agreements are automatically void.
3 Article 1013 establishes exemptions if the collusion is for distributional or technological innovation gives consumers a fair share of the benefit and does not include unreasonable restraints that risk eliminating competition anywhere or compliant with the general principle of European Union law of proportionality.
4 Article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing.
5 Article 102 allows the European Council to regulations to govern mergers between firms the current regulation is the Regulation 1392004EC.
6 The general test is whether a concentration ie.
7 merger or acquisition with a community dimension ie.
8 affects a number of EU member states might significantly impede effective competition.
9 Articles 106 and 107 provide that member states right to deliver public services may not be obstructed but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies.
10 Article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for charities regional development objectives and in the event of a natural disaster.
11 In which article does the Treaty of Lisbon prohibit anticompetitive agreements?	Article 1011	1
12 What does Article 102 of the Treaty of Lisbon prohibit?	the abuse of dominant position	4
13 Which articles state that the member states rights to deliver public services may not be obstructed?	Articles 106 and 107	9

1 While the concept of a social market economy was only introduced into EU law in 2007 free movement and trade were central to European development since the Treaty of Rome 1957.
2 According to the standard theory of comparative advantage two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects.
3 Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association or the World Trade Organisation breaking down barriers to trade and enhancing free movement of goods services labour and capital is meant to reduce consumer prices.
4 It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union which led to a common market then monetary union then union of monetary and fiscal policy political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state.
5 In Europe however those stages were considerably mixed and it remains unclear whether the endgame should be the same as a state traditionally understood.
6 In practice free trade without standards to ensure fair trade can benefit some people and groups within countries particularly big business much more than others but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market particularly workers consumers small business developing industries and communities.
7 The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons services and capital.
8 These socalled four freedoms were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers eg.
9 customs technical barriers eg.
10 differing laws on safety consumer or environmental standards and fiscal barriers eg.
11 different Value Added Tax rates.
12 The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit.
13 The Treaties limit free trade to prioritise other values such as public health consumer protection labour rights fair competition and environmental improvement.
14 Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of peoples well being.
15 When was the concept of a social market economy introduced into EU law?	2007	1
16 How long has free movement and trade been central to European development?	1957	1
17 Breaking down barriers to trade and enhancing the free movement of goods is meant to reduce what?	consumer prices	3
18 What do the Treaties generally limit?	free trade	13
19  What entity has taken the view that the goals of free trade are underpinned by the aims to improve peoples well being?	the Court of Justice	14
1 Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union and the principle of nondiscrimination.
2 The EU manages imports from nonmember states duties between member states are prohibited and imports circulate freely.
3 In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34 ‘Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States’.
4 In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all trading rules that are enacted by Member States which could hinder trade directly or indirectly actually or potentially would be caught by article 34.
5 This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful.
6 It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville who could not get certificates from authorities in France where they bought the Scotch.
7 This wide test to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade applies equally to actions by quasigovernment bodies such as the former Buy Irish company that had government appointees.
8 It also means states can be responsible for private actors.
9 For instance in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries and even Belgian tomato imports.
10 France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities ‘manifestly and persistently abstained from preventing the sabotage.
11 Generally speaking if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports or exports under TFEU article 35 then it must be justified under article 36.
12 The justifications include public morality policy or security protection of health and life of humans animals or plants national treasures of artistic historic or archaeological value and industrial and commercial property.
13 In addition although not clearly listed environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11.
14 More generally it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules.
15 So in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13 Brenner Autobahn en route to Italy.
16 Although many companies including Mr Schmidbergers German undertaking were prevented from trading the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the ‘fundamental pillars of a democratic society’ against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced and was probably subordinate.
17 If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately.
18 This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and 1 be suitable to achieve the aim 2 be necessary so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result and 3 be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36.
19 What helps the process of free movement of goods?	a customs union  and the principle of nondiscrimination	1
20 What did did article 34 discriminate against in Procureur du Roi v Dassonville?	parallel importers like Mr Dassonville	6
21 Article 34 meant states could be responsible for what?	private actors	8
22 In which case were French vigilantes sabotaging shipments of Spanish Strawberries?	Commission v France	9
23 In Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice came to the conclusion that Austria didnt infringe upon article 34 by failing to ban a what?	a protest that blocked heavy traffic	15
1 Often rules apply to all goods neutrally but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products.
2 For such indirect discriminatory or indistinctly applicable measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications either those in article 36 or additional mandatory or overriding requirements such as consumer protection improving labour standards protecting the environment press diversity fairness in commerce and more the categories are not closed.
3 In the most famous case ReweZentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Branntwein the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs not just imported ones to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34 because it had a greater negative effect on imports.
4 German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol but Cassis de Dijon which ReweZentrale AG wished to import from France only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol.
5 The Court of Justice rejected the German governments arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36 because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought.
6 This rule primarily applies to requirements about a products content or packaging.
7 In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34 and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection.
8 The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate it would considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view and labelling would protect consumers just as effectively.
9 In a 2003 case Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as chocolate.
10 It had to be chocolate substitute.
11 All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone but British Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats.
12 They claimed the law infringed article 34.
13 The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a chocolate substitute label.
14 This was derogatory in the consumers eyes.
15 A ‘neutral and objective statement’ was enough to protect consumers.
16 If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product this can also infringe article 34.
17 So in a 2009 case Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34.
18 Again the law applied neutrally to everyone but disproportionately affected importers because Italian companies did not make trailers.
19 This was not a product requirement but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it it would have a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers that affects the access of that product to the market.
20 It would require justification under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement.
21 What is the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?	25	3
22 Which country did ReweZentrale AG wish to import from?	France	4
23 Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?	2003	9
24 All Italian chocolate is made from what alone?	cocoa butter	11
25  In the 2009 Commission v Italy case the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?	motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers	17
1 In contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access the Court of Justice developed a presumption that selling arrangements would be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34 if they applied equally to all sellers and affected them in the same manner in fact.
2 In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price was unlawful.
3 The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition not to hinder trade.
4 The Court of Justice held as in law and in fact it was an equally applicable selling arrangement not something that alters a products content it was outside the scope of article 34 and so did not need to be justified.
5 Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect in fact particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing.
6 In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12 and misleading commercials for skin care products.
7 While the bans have remained justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were the only effective form of promotion enabling a trader to penetrate the market.
8 In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers traditional social practices and to local habits and customs to buy their products but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health.
9 Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour is misleading or aggressive and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair.
10 Increasingly states have to give mutual recognition to each others standards of regulation while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice.
11 The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory race to the bottom while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent.
12 Which two importers claimed that under a French competition law they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?	Keck and Mithouard	2
13 The aim of the French competition law was to do what?	cut throat competition	3
14 In which case did the Court of Justice review Swedish bans on advertising to young children under 12?	Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini	6
15 Under which Directive did the EU harmonize restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising?	the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive	9
1 Since its foundation the Treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement.
2 Reflecting the economic nature of the project the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers as a factor of production.
3 However from the 1970s this focus shifted towards developing a more social Europe.
4 Free movement was increasingly based on citizenship so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights.
5 This means the basic worker rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21.
6 According to the Court of Justice a worker is anybody who is economically active which includes everyone in an employment relationship under the direction of another person for remuneration.
7 A job however need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker.
8 For example in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community which provided for everyones material needs irrespective of their contributions.
9 The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay so long as there was at least an indirect quid pro quo for the work he did.
10 Having worker status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments and employers in access to employment tax and social security rights.
11 By contrast a citizen who is any person having the nationality of a Member State TFEU article 201 has rights to seek work vote in local and European elections but more restricted rights to claim social security.
12 In practice free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away peoples jobs and benefits paradoxically at the same time.
13 Nevertheless practically all available research finds little impact of labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers.
14 What have the Treaties sought to enable since its foundation?	to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement	1
15 Which entity focused upon the free movement of workers?	the European Community	2
16 What was free movement increasingly based on?	citizenship	4
17 In which case did a German man claim the right to live in Netherlands where he was a volunteer plumber?	Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie	8
18 What did the Court of Justice say Steymann was entitled to?	to stay  so long as there was at least an indirect quid pro quo for the work he did	9
1 The Free Movement of Workers Regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers.
2 First articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment conclude contracts and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state.
3 In a famous case the Belgian Football Association v Bosman a Belgian footballer named JeanMarc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from RFC.
4 de Liège to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Liège the habitual transfer fees.
5 The Court of Justice held the transfer rules constituted an obstacle to free movement and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest but this was unlikely.
6 In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language but only if the measure was not disproportionate.
7 By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano Italy was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano.
8 The Court of Justice giving horizontal direct effect to TFEU article 45 reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate and because it was impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means the measure was disproportionate.
9 Second article 72 requires equal treatment in respect of tax.
10 In Finanzamt Köln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits eg.
11 for married couples and social insurance expense deductions to a man who worked in Germany but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits.
12 By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion für Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigels claim that a reregistration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement.
13 Although the tax was likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement because the charge applied equally to Austrians in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified.
14 Third people must receive equal treatment regarding social advantages although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods.
15 In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium because the benefit was closely linked to the socioeconomic situation of the Netherlands.
16 Conversely in Geven v Land NordrheinWestfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany did not have a right to receive German child benefits even though the wife of a man who worked fulltime in Germany but was resident in Austria could.
17 The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 453 are public policy public security or public health and there is also a general exception in article 454 for employment in the public service.

1 Citizenship of the EU has increasingly been seen as a fundamental status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice and has accordingly increased the number of social services that people can access wherever they move.
2 The Court has required that higher education along with other forms of vocational training should be more access albeit with qualifying periods.
3 In Commission v Austria the Court held that Austria was not entitled to restrict places in Austrian universities to Austrian students to avoid structural staffing and financial problems if mainly German foreign students applied for places because there was little evidence of an actual problem.
4 What has lately been being viewed as a fundamental status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice?	Citizenship of the EU	1
5 What has having an EU Citizenship increased?	the number of social services that people can access wherever they move	1
6 In which case did the Court state that Austria was not allowed to hold places in Austrian schools exclusively for Austrian students?	Commission v Austria	3
7 What has the Court required to be more accessible?	higher education	2
1 As well as creating rights for workers who generally lack bargaining power in the market the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also protects the freedom of establishment in article 49 and freedom to provide services in article 56.
2 In Gebhard v Consiglio dell’Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be established means to participate in economic life on a stable and continuous basis while providing services meant pursuing activity more on a temporary basis.
3 This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom rather than service freedom.
4 However the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were nondiscriminatory justified by imperative requirements in the general interest and proportionately applied.
5 All people or entities that engage in economic activity particularly the selfemployed or undertakings such as companies or firms have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions.
6 The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment so article 49 has both vertical and horizontal direct effect.
7 In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified.
8 TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others freedom of establishment when they exercise official authority but this did an advocates work as opposed to a courts was not official.
9 By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction.
10 The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market.
11 Therefore there was no prima facie infringement freedom of establishment that needed to be justified.
12 Which Treaty protects the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services?	the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union	1
13 In Gebhard v ConsiglioMilano the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice law would be allowed under what conditions?	if they were nondiscriminatory	4
14 In which case did the Court of Justice state that refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he did not have Belgian heritage wasnt able to be justified?	Reyners v Belgium	7
15 Which TFEU article states that states are exempt from infringing on rights of establishment when they exercise official authority?	article 49	8

1 In 2006 a toxic waste spill off the coast of Côte dIvoire from a European ship prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste.
2 Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas stated that Such highly toxic waste should never have left the European Union.
3 With countries such as Spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic waste Franco Frattini the Justice Freedom and Security Commissioner proposed with Dimas to create criminal sentences for ecological crimes.
4 The competence for the Union to do this was contested in 2005 at the Court of Justice resulting in a victory for the Commission.
5 That ruling set a precedent that the Commission on a supranational basis may legislate in criminal law – something never done before.
6 So far the only other proposal has been the draft intellectual property rights directive.
7 Motions were tabled in the European Parliament against that legislation on the basis that criminal law should not be an EU competence but was rejected at vote.
8 However in October 2007 the Court of Justice ruled that the Commission could not propose what the criminal sanctions could be only that there must be some.
9 In which year did a toxic waste spill from a European ship prompt the Commission to look into legislation against waste?	2006	1
10 At the time countries such as Spain didnt have a crime against what?	shipping toxic waste	3
11 When did the Court of Justice rule that the Commission could only propose that there must be some criminal sanctions?	October 2007	8
12 When was the competence for the Union to create criminal sentences for ecological crimes contested?	2005	4
1 The freedom to provide services under TFEU article 56 applies to people who give services for remuneration especially commercial or professional activity.
2 For example in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice.
3 The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied it was directly effective and the rule was probably unjustified having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice.
4 The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56 because usually the state funds it though higher education does not.
5 Health care generally counts as a service.
6 In GeraetsSmits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs GeraetsSmits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany.
7 The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary so she argued this restricted the freedom of the German health clinic to provide services.
8 Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic and should not fall within article 56.
9 But the Court of Justice held health was a service even though the government rather than the service recipient paid for the service.
10 National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay and it followed international medical science on which treatments counted as normal and necessary.
11 The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists and this is also true in the context of the UKs National Health Service.
12 Aside from public services another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal.
13 Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands regulation of cannabis consumption including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists but not Dutch nationals going to coffee shops fell outside article 56 altogether.
14 The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasilegal activity was subject to restriction.
15 If an activity does fall within article 56 a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice.
16 In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financiën a business that sold commodities futures with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers.
17 The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent undesirable developments in securities trading including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets.
18 In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a laserdrome business was banned by the Bonn council.
19 It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd but residents had protested against playing at killing entertainment.
20 The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity which underpinned the ban did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services.
21 In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where peoples views were highly divergent.
22 The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet.
23 In the Services Directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed.
24 The freedom to provide services under TFEU article 56 applies to who?	to people who give services for remuneration	1
25 Why was the Dutch lawyer who moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social society case told he couldnt continue?	because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice	2
26 What did the Court of Justice reason were controlled in all member states in Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht?	narcotic drugs	14
27 What did the Dutch health authorities regard as unnecessary in GeraetsSmits v Stichting Ziekenfonds?	the treatment	7
1 In regard to companies the Court of Justice held in R Daily Mail and General Trust plc v HM Treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business without infringing TFEU article 49.
2 This meant the Daily Mail newspapers parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK.
3 The UK did not need to justify its action as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised.
4 By contrast in Centros Ltd v Erhversusog Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmarks minimum share capital rules.
5 UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company while Denmarks legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200000 Danish krone around €27000 to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent.
6 The Court of Justice held that Denmarks minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltds freedom of establishment and could not be justified because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection.
7 This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition and a race to the bottom in standards like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards and low corporate taxes as a result.
8 Similarly in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany.
9 Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection labour rights to participate in work or the public interest in collecting taxes denial of capacity went too far it was an outright negation of the right of establishment.
10 However in Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose.
11 This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary.
12 Thus the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies where restrictions must be justified and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory although it is not entirely clear why.
13 Which newspapers parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands?	the Daily Mail	2
14 How much capital did UK law require to start a company?	£1	5
15 How much capital did Danish law require to start a company?	200 000 Danish krone	5
16 What could justify restrictions on freedom of establishment?	creditor protection  labour rights to participate in work  or the public interest in collecting taxes	9
17 In which case did the Court of Justice hold that a German court couldnt deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract based in Germany?	Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH	8

1 Following the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent.
2 From 66–34 Mya the rainforest extended as far south as 45°.
3 Climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics.
4 During the Oligocene for example the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band.
5 It expanded again during the Middle Miocene then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum.

1 During the midEocene it is believed that the drainage basin of the Amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the Purus Arch.
2 Water on the eastern side flowed toward the Atlantic while to the west water flowed toward the Pacific across the Amazonas Basin.
3 As the Andes Mountains rose however a large basin was created that enclosed a lake now known as the Solimões Basin.

1 There is evidence that there have been significant changes in Amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21000 years through the Last Glacial Maximum LGM and subsequent deglaciation.
2 Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin.
3 There is debate however over how extensive this reduction was.
4 Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north south and east than is seen today.
5 This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.

1 For a long time it was thought that the Amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil.
2 Archeologist Betty Meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea as described in her book Amazonia Man and Culture in a Counterfeit Paradise.
3 She claimed that a population density of 02 inhabitants per square kilometre 052sq mi is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting with agriculture needed to host a larger population.
4 However recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated.
5 Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500 divided between dense coastal settlements such as that at Marajó and inland dwellers.
6 By 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200000.

1 The first European to travel the length of the Amazon River was Francisco de Orellana in 1542.
2 The BBCs Unnatural Histories presents evidence that Orellana rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the Amazon in the 1540s.
3 It is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from Europe such as smallpox.
4 Since the 1970s numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between AD 0–1250 furthering claims about PreColumbian civilizations.
5 Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over Acre.
6 The BBCs Unnatural Histories presented evidence that the Amazon rainforest rather than being a pristine wilderness has been shaped by man for at least 11000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta.

1 Terra preta black earth which is distributed over large areas in the Amazon forest is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management.
2 The development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment meaning that large portions of the Amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed.
3 In the region of the Xingu tribe remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the Amazon forest were found in 2003 by Michael Heckenberger and colleagues of the University of Florida.
4 Among those were evidence of roads bridges and large plazas.

1 Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to nonforested areas.
2 The main sources of deforestation in the Amazon are human settlement and development of the land.
3 Prior to the early 1960s access to the forests interior was highly restricted and the forest remained basically intact.
4 Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method.
5 However the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion.
6 The soils in the Amazon are productive for just a short period of time so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land.
7 These farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage.
8 Deforestation is considerable and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space.

13 What is notable about the Amazon forest when it is seen from space?	areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye	8
1 Between 1991 and 2000 the total area of forest lost in the Amazon rose from 415000 to 587000 square kilometres 160000 to 227000 sq mi with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle.
2 Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon and 91 of land deforested since 1970 is used for livestock pasture.
3 Currently Brazil is the secondlargest global producer of soybeans after the United States.
4 New research however conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the Amazon the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes.
5 So despite the popular perception there has been no economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields.

1 The needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the Amazon.
2 The first two highways successfully opened up the rainforest and led to increased settlement and deforestation.
3 The mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 22392 km2 or 8646 sq mi per year was 18 higher than in the previous five years 19018 km2 or 7343 sq mi per year.

1 In 2005 parts of the Amazon basin experienced the worst drought in one hundred years and there were indications that 2006 could have been a second successive year of drought.
2 A July 23 2006 article in the UK newspaper The Independent reported Woods Hole Research Center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought.
3 Scientists at the Brazilian National Institute of Amazonian Research argue in the article that this drought response coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate are pushing the rainforest towards a tipping point where it would irreversibly start to die.
4 It concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert with catastrophic consequences for the worlds climate.

1 Ctenophora tᵻˈnɒfərə singular ctenophore ˈtɛnəfɔːr or ˈtiːnəfɔːr from the Greek κτείς kteis comb and φέρω pherō carry commonly known as comb jellies is a phylum of animals that live in marine waters worldwide.
2 Their most distinctive feature is the ‘combs’ – groups of cilia which they use for swimming – they are the largest animals that swim by means of cilia.
3 Adults of various species range from a few millimeters to 15 m 4 ft 11 in in size.
4 Like cnidarians their bodies consist of a mass of jelly with one layer of cells on the outside and another lining the internal cavity.
5 In ctenophores these layers are two cells deep while those in cnidarians are only one cell deep.
6 Some authors combined ctenophores and cnidarians in one phylum Coelenterata as both groups rely on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration.
7 Increasing awareness of the differences persuaded more recent authors to classify them as separate phyla.

1 Almost all ctenophores are predators taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans the exceptions are juveniles of two species which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed.
2 In favorable circumstances ctenophores can eat ten times their own weight in a day.
3 Only 100–150 species have been validated and possibly another 25 have not been fully described and named.
4 The textbook examples are cydippids with eggshaped bodies and a pair of retractable tentacles fringed with tentilla little tentacles that are covered with colloblasts sticky cells that capture prey.
5 The phylum has a wide range of body forms including the flattened deepsea platyctenids in which the adults of most species lack combs and the coastal beroids which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large stiffened cilia that act as teeth.
6 These variations enable different species to build huge populations in the same area because they specialize in different types of prey which they capture by as wide a range of methods as spiders use.

19 How many different species of ctenohore are there?	100–150 species	3
1 Most species are hermaphrodites—a single animal can produce both eggs and sperm meaning it can fertilize its own egg not needing a mate.
2 Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time.
3 Others are sequential hermaphrodites in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times.
4 Fertilization is generally external although platyctenids eggs are fertilized inside their parents bodies and kept there until they hatch.
5 The young are generally planktonic and in most species look like miniature cydippids gradually changing into their adult shapes as they grow.
6 The exceptions are the beroids whose young are miniature beroids with large mouths and no tentacles and the platyctenids whose young live as cydippidlike plankton until they reach nearadult size but then sink to the bottom and rapidly metamorphose into the adult form.
7 In at least some species juveniles are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape.
8 The combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate.

1 Ctenophores may be abundant during the summer months in some coastal locations but in other places they are uncommon and difficult to find.
2 In bays where they occur in very high numbers predation by ctenophores may control the populations of small zooplanktonic organisms such as copepods which might otherwise wipe out the phytoplankton planktonic plants which are a vital part of marine food chains.
3 One ctenophore Mnemiopsis has accidentally been introduced into the Black Sea where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish.
4 The situation was aggravated by other factors such as overfishing and longterm environmental changes that promoted the growth of the Mnemiopsis population.
5 The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.

1 Despite their soft gelatinous bodies fossils thought to represent ctenophores apparently with no tentacles but many more combrows than modern forms have been found in lagerstätten as far back as the early Cambrian about 515 million years ago.
2 The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated and the majority view at present based on molecular phylogenetics is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores.
3 A recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippidlike and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently probably after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago.
4 Evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the cydippids are not monophyletic in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids.
5 When did the CretaceousPaleogene extinction happen?	66 million years ago	3
6 Evidence indicates that Cydippids are not what?	monophyletic	4
7 How old are the fossils found that represent ctenophhores ?	515 million years	1

1 Ctenophores form an animal phylum that is more complex than sponges about as complex as cnidarians jellyfish sea anemones etc.
2  and less complex than bilaterians which include almost all other animals.
3 Unlike sponges both ctenophores and cnidarians have cells bound by intercell connections and carpetlike basement membranes muscles nervous systems and some have sensory organs.
4 Ctenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts which are sticky and adhere to prey although a few ctenophore species lack them.

1 Like sponges and cnidarians ctenophores have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jellylike material which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jellylike layer.
2 Hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic along with sponges.
3 Both ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle that in more complex animals arises from the middle cell layer and as a result some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic while others still regard them as diploblastic.

1 Ranging from about 1 millimeter 0039 in to 15 meters 49 ft in size ctenophores are the largest noncolonial animals that use cilia hairs as their main method of locomotion.
2 Most species have eight strips called comb rows that run the length of their bodies and bear comblike bands of cilia called ctenes stacked along the comb rows so that when the cilia beat those of each comb touch the comb below.
3 The name ctenophora means combbearing from the Greek κτείς stemform κτεν meaning comb and the Greek suffix φορος meaning carrying.
4 What are the hairs on ctenophores called?	cilia	1
5 What are cilia used for?	method of locomotion	1
6 Comb like bands of cilia are called what?	ctenes	2
7 What does ctenophore mean in Greek?	combbearing	3
1 For a phylum with relatively few species ctenophores have a wide range of body plans.
2 Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study.
3 In addition oceanic species do not preserve well and are known mainly from photographs and from observers notes.
4 Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia Beroe and Mnemiopsis.
5 At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.
6 Which cidippid is used as a description on ctenophores in most textbooks?	Pleurobrachia	5
7 Which group of ctenophore are are hardest to study?	oceanic species	2
8 Why are coastal species tough?	to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles	2
9 Which ctenophora have been studies the most?	Pleurobrachia  Beroe and Mnemiopsis	4
1 The internal cavity forms a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles a pharynx throat a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach and a system of internal canals.
2 These branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal the mouth and pharynx the roots of the tentacles if present all along the underside of each comb row and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth – two of these four branches terminate in anal pores.
3 The inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium the gastrodermis.
4 The mouth and pharynx have both cilia and welldeveloped muscles.
5 In other parts of the canal system the gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to and furthest from the organ that it supplies.
6 The nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles internal compartments germ cells that produce eggs or sperm and photocytes that produce bioluminescence.
7 The side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated cells that circulate water through the canals punctuated by ciliary rosettes pores that are surrounded by double whorls of cilia and connect to the mesoglea.
8 The inside of a ctenophore is lined with what?	epithelium	3
9 What do photocytes produce?	bioluminescence	6
10 What is the throat called?	pharynx	1
11 What does the internal cavity contain?	a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles a pharynx throat a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach and a system of internal canals	1
12 What are the most active parts of ctenophora?	the mouth and pharynx	2
1 The outer surface bears usually eight comb rows called swimmingplates which are used for swimming.
2 The rows are oriented to run from near the mouth the oral pole to the opposite end the aboral pole and are spaced more or less evenly around the body although spacing patterns vary by species and in most species the comb rows extend only part of the distance from the aboral pole towards the mouth.
3 The combs also called ctenes or comb plates run across each row and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia up to 2 millimeters 0079 in.
4 Unlike conventional cilia and flagella which has a filament structure arranged in a 9  2 pattern these cilia are arranged in a 9  3 pattern where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function.
5 These normally beat so that the propulsion stroke is away from the mouth although they can also reverse direction.
6 Hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is pointing unlike jellyfish.
7 When trying to escape predators one species can accelerate to six times its normal speed some other species reverse direction as part of their escape behavior by reversing the power stroke of the comb plate cilia.
8 What are the eight comb rows on the outer surface called?	swimmingplates	1
9 Combs are called what?	also called ctenes or comb plates	3
10 What does the 9 3 pattern of cilia thought to do?	supporting function	4
11 What direction do ctenophore swim?	in the direction in which the mouth is pointing 	6
12 Cilia can g ow up too what length?	2 millimeters 0079 in	3
1 It is uncertain how ctenophores control their buoyancy but experiments have shown that some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities.
2 Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater.
3 If they enter less dense brackish water the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density to avoid sinking.
4 Conversely if they move from brackish to fullstrength seawater the rosettes may pump water out of the mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density.
5 How do ctenophores control buoyancy?	osmotic pressure	1
6 Ciliary rosettes pump water into what to control buoyancy?	the mesoglea	3
7 What does pumping water into the mesoglea do?	increase its bulk and decrease its density	3

1 The largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ at the opposite end from the mouth.
2 Its main component is a statocyst a balance sensor consisting of a statolith a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia called balancers that sense its orientation.
3 The statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long immobile cilia.
4 A ctenophore does not automatically try to keep the statolith resting equally on all the balancers.
5 Instead its response is determined by the animals mood in other words the overall state of the nervous system.
6 For example if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey it will often put some comb rows into reverse spinning the mouth towards the prey.

1 Cydippid ctenophores have bodies that are more or less rounded sometimes nearly spherical and other times more cylindrical or eggshaped the common coastal sea gooseberry Pleurobrachia sometimes has an eggshaped body with the mouth at the narrow end although some individuals are more uniformly round.
2 From opposite sides of the body extends a pair of long slender tentacles each housed in a sheath into which it can be withdrawn.
3 Some species of cydippids have bodies that are flattened to various extents so that they are wider in the plane of the tentacles.
4 What is the common coastal pleurobrachia called?	sea gooseberry	1
5 What does the pleurobrachia have on opposite sides of its body?	a pair of long  slender tentacles	2
6 Cydippid are typically what shape?	more or less rounded	1
7 The long tentacles on the pleurbrachia are protected by what?	a sheath	2
8 Where is the mouth located on the pleuobrachia located?	at the narrow end	1
1 The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla little tentacles although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches.
2 The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it.
3 Colloblasts are specialized mushroomshaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis and have three main components a domed head with vesicles chambers that contain adhesive a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk.
4 The function of the spiral thread is uncertain but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart.
5 In addition to colloblasts members of the genus Haeckelia which feed mainly on jellyfish incorporate their victims stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidariaeating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense.
6 The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids they contain striated muscle a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora and they are coiled when relaxed while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed.
7 Euplokamis tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey they may flick out very quickly in 40 to 60 milliseconds they can wriggle which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms and they coil round prey.
8 The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle.
9 The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles but of a highly specialized type.
10 Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.
11 What are the tentacles of cydipped ctenophores are usually fringed with?	tentilla	1
12 What are colloblasts?	specialized mushroomshaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis	3
13 What makes the tentilla of euplokamis different from other cysippids?	they contain striated muscle 	6
14 How many types of movements do euplokamis tentilla have?	three types of movement	7
15 What does the euplokamis use the three types of movement for?	capturing prey	7
1 There are eight rows of combs that run from near the mouth to the opposite end and are spaced evenly round the body.
2 The combs beat in a metachronal rhythm rather like that of a Mexican wave.
3 From each balancer in the statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under the dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows.
4 This forms a mechanical system for transmitting the beat rhythm from the combs to the balancers via water disturbances created by the cilia.
5 How many rows of combs are there?	eight rows	1
6 Where are the rows of combs located?	from near the mouth to the opposite end	1
7 How are the combs spaced?	evenly round the body	1
8 What runs from the balancer in the statocyst to the comb rows?	ciliary groove	3
1 The Lobata have a pair of lobes which are muscular cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth.
2 Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes rather than trailing far behind as in the Cydippida.
3 Between the lobes on either side of the mouth many species of lobates have four auricles gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth.
4 This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey.
5 What does the lobata have pair of?	lobes	1
6 What are auricles?	gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents	3
7 How many auricles do most species have?	four	3
8 What do the auricles do?	help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth	3
9 What do lobates feed on?	suspended planktonic prey	4
1 Lobates have eight combrows originating at the aboral pole and usually not extending beyond the body to the lobes in species with four auricles the cilia edging the auricles are extensions of cilia in four of the comb rows.
2 Most lobates are quite passive when moving through the water using the cilia on their comb rows for propulsion although Leucothea has long and active auricles whose movements also contribute to propulsion.
3 Members of the lobate genera Bathocyroe and Ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly.
4 Unlike cydippids the movements of lobates combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia yet combs on the same row beat in the same Mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids.
5 This may have enabled lobates to grow larger than cydippids and to have shapes that are less egglike.
6 What does the bathocyroe and ocyropsis do to escape danger?	by clapping their lobes	3
7 What happens when bathocyroe and ocyropsis clap their lobes together?	jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly	3
8 The movements of the lobates combs are controlled by what?	nerves	4
9 Cydippids combs are controlled by what?	water disturbances created by the cilia	4
1 The Beroida also known as Nuda have no feeding appendages but their large pharynx just inside the large mouth and filling most of the saclike body bears macrocilia at the oral end.
2 These fused bundles of several thousand large cilia are able to bite off pieces of prey that are too large to swallow whole – almost always other ctenophores.
3 In front of the field of macrocilia on the mouth lips in some species of Beroe is a pair of narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells on the stomach wall that zip the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding by forming intercellular connections with the opposite adhesive strip.
4 This tight closure streamlines the front of the animal when it is pursuing prey.
5 Beroida are known by what other name?	Nuda	1
6 What group has no feeding appendages?	The Beroida	1
7 Some species of beroe have a pair of strips of adhesive cells on the stomach wall What does it do?	zip the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding 	3

9 What does the beroida have instead of feeding appendages?	large pharynx	1
1 The Cestida belt animals are ribbonshaped planktonic animals with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon.
2 There is a pair of combrows along each aboral edge and tentilla emerging from a groove all along the oral edge which stream back across most of the winglike body surface.
3 Cestids can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their combrows.
4 There are two known species with worldwide distribution in warm and warmtemperate waters Cestum veneris Venus girdle is among the largest ctenophores – up to 15 meters 49 ft long and can undulate slowly or quite rapidly.
5 Velamen parallelum which is typically less than 20 centimeters 066 ft long can move much faster in what has been described as a darting motion.
6 Which species are ribbonshaped planktonic animals?	The Cestida	1
7 What is the largest ctenophore?	Cestum veneris	4

1 Most Platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the oralaboral direction with a pair of tentillabearing tentacles on the aboral surface.
2 They cling to and creep on surfaces by everting the pharynx and using it as a muscular foot.
3 All but one of the known platyctenid species lack combrows.
4 Platyctenids are usually cryptically colored live on rocks algae or the body surfaces of other invertebrates and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many sidebranches seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore into the current.

1 Almost all species are hermaphrodites in other words they function as both males and females at the same time – except that in two species of the genus Ocryopsis individuals remain of the same single sex all their lives.
2 The gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis.
3 Fertilization is external in most species but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch.
4 Selffertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are selffertile.
5 How are eggs and sperm released?	via pores in the epidermis	2

8 Where are the gonads located?	in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows	2
9 Is fertilization  internal or exeternal in most species?	external	3
1 Development of the fertilized eggs is direct in other words there is no distinctive larval form and juveniles of all groups generally resemble miniature cydippid adults.
2 In the genus Beroe the juveniles like the adults lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths.
3 In most species the juveniles gradually develop the body forms of their parents.
4 In some groups such as the flat bottomdwelling platyctenids the juveniles behave more like true larvae as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis after dropping to the seafloor.
5 Juvenile and adult  beroe lack what?	tentacles and tentacle sheaths	2
6 Where do juvenile platyctenids live?	among the plankton	4

9 Which genus lack tentacles and sheaths?	Beroe	2
1 When some species including Bathyctena chuni Euplokamis stationis and Eurhamphaea vexilligera are disturbed they produce secretions ink that luminesce at much the same wavelengths as their bodies.
2 Juveniles will luminesce more brightly in relation to their body size than adults whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies.
3 Detailed statistical investigation has not suggested the function of ctenophores bioluminescence nor produced any correlation between its exact color and any aspect of the animals environments such as depth or whether they live in coastal or midocean waters.
4 What do bathyctena chuni euplokamis stationis and eurhamphaea vexilligera have in common?	they produce secretions ink that luminesce	1
5 When do bathyctena chuni euplokamis stationis and eurhamphaea vexilligera  excrete secretions?	are disturbed 	1
6 What are the secretions commonly called?	ink	1
7 Do adults or juveniles secretions luminesce brighter?	Juveniles will luminesce more brightly	2
1 Almost all ctenophores are predators – there are no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic.
2 If food is plentiful they can eat 10 times their own weight per day.
3 While Beroe preys mainly on other ctenophores other surfacewater species prey on zooplankton planktonic animals ranging in size from the microscopic including mollusc and fish larvae to small adult crustaceans such as copepods amphipods and even krill.
4 Members of the genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their preys nematocysts stinging cells into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts.
5 Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques from capturing prey – some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as webs some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread as bolas spiders do.
6 This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species.
7 The twotentacled cydippid Lampea feeds exclusively on salps close relatives of seasquirts that form large chainlike floating colonies and juveniles of Lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow.
8 Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey Pleurobrachias long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.
9 Are ctenophores predators vegetarian or parasitic?	Almost all ctenophores are predators	1
10 Haeckelia prey mostly on what animal?	jellyfish	4
11 What happens to the jellyfish nematocysts when they are eaten by the haeckelia?	incorporate their preys nematocysts stinging cells into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts	4
12 What does the bolinopsis generally eat?	smaller  weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae	8
13 What is the name of the twotentacled cydippid that feedsentirely on salps called?	Lampea	7
1 Ctenophores used to be regarded as dead ends in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals.
2 It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue.
3 Detailed investigation of chum salmon Oncorhynchus keta showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around.
4 Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores.
5 Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations.
6 Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population most fish that prey on them are generalists and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jellyeaters.
7 This is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the Red Sea.
8 The larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores as are the larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood.
9 Why was it thought that  ctenophores were a poor diet for other animals?	their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water	1
10 What is the oncorhynchus also called?	chum salmon	3
11 What do beroids typically eat?	ctenophores	4
12 Where have herbivorous fishes been seen feeding on gelatinous zooplankton?	the Red Sea	7
13 Turtles and jellyfish can eat large quantities of what?	ctenophores 	5
1 On the other hand in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish.
2 Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities.
3 The impact was increased by chronic overfishing and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a shortterm boost causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores.
4 Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsiseating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993 which significantly slowed the animals metabolism.
5 However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to preMnemiopsis levels.
6 What is blamed for causing the sharp drop in fish catches in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov?	ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi	1
7 How was the ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi introduced into The Black Sea and the Sea of Azov?	via the ballast tanks of ships	1
8 How was the population of mnemiopsis in The black Sea and the Sea of Azov brought under control?	by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsiseating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata 	4
9 When was ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi introduced into The Black Sea and the Sea of Azov?	in the late 1980s	1
10 How does cooling of the local environment affect the mnemiopsis?	significantly slowed the animals metabolism	4
1 Because of their soft gelatinous bodies ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstätten places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue.
2 Until the mid1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known both members of the crown group from the early Devonian Emsian period.
3 Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age about 505 million years ago in the midCambrian period.
4 All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows far more than the 8 typical of living species.
5 They also appear to have had internal organlike structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores.
6 One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular.
7 Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian but perhaps very different from modern species – for example one fossils combrows were mounted on prominent vanes.
8 The Ediacaran Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly.

1 The early Cambrian sessile frondlike fossil Stromatoveris from Chinas Chengjiang lagerstätte and dated to about 515 million years ago is very similar to Vendobionta of the preceding Ediacaran period.
2 DeGan Shu Simon Conway Morris et al.
3 found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia used for filter feeding.
4 They suggested that Stromatoveris was an evolutionary aunt of ctenophores and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system.

1 The relationship of ctenophores to the rest of Metazoa is very important to our understanding of the early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity.
2 It has been the focus of debate for many years.
3 Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria sister to the Cnidaria sister to Cnidaria Placozoa and Bilateria and sister to all other animal phyla.
4 A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways eg homeoboxes nuclear receptors the Wnt signaling pathway and sodium channels showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla.
5 Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals.
6 This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages eg Porifera or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage.
7 However other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes and that Porifera sponges is the earliestdiverging animal phylum instead.
8 Ctenophores and sponges are also the only known animal phyla that lack any true hox genes.
9 Recent studies believe  that ctenophores are the sister lineage to what?	all other animals	5
10 What do some researchers believe is the earliestdiverging animal phylum is?	Porifera	7
1 Since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippidlike larvae it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids having an eggshaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles.
2 Richard Harbisons purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid.
3 Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids.
4 He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippidlike or beroidlike.
5 A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001 using 26 species including 4 recently discovered ones confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippidlike.
6 It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small – so small that the relationships between the Lobata Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain.
7 This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 655 million years ago while other lineages perished.
8 When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain.

3 The original development of this area began circa 1910 on 190 acres of what had been an alfalfa field.
4 The Alta Vista Tract as the land would become known was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation and was officially platted in 1911.
5 The tracts boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south Cedar Avenue on the east the rear property line of Platt Avenue east of Sixth Street and Platt Avenue west of Sixth Street on the north and First Street on the west.
6 The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912 in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community.
7 At the time of its admission to the City the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon.
8 In 1914 developers Billings  Meyering acquired the tract completed street development provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service and began marketing the property with fervor.
9 A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes.

1 Starting in the late 1950s American computer scientist Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching with the goal to provide a faulttolerant efficient routing method for telecommunication messages as part of a research program at the RAND Corporation funded by the US Department of Defense.
2 This concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of preallocation of network bandwidth largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in the Bell System.
3 The new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory United Kingdom NPL in the late 1960s.
4 Davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe in the decade following including the incorporation of the concept in the early ARPANET in the United States.

1 Packet mode communication may be implemented with or without intermediate forwarding nodes packet switches or routers.
2 Packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using firstin firstout buffering but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing traffic shaping or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket.
3 In case of a shared physical medium such as radio or 10BASE5 the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme.

1 Baran developed the concept of distributed adaptive message block switching during his research at the RAND Corporation for the US Air Force into survivable communications networks first presented to the Air Force in the summer of 1961 as briefing B265 later published as RAND report P2626 in 1962 and finally in report RM 3420 in 1964.
2 Report P2626 described a general architecture for a largescale distributed survivable communications network.
3 The work focuses on three key ideas use of a decentralized network with multiple paths between any two points dividing user messages into message blocks later called packets and delivery of these messages by store and forward switching.

3 Each packet is labeled with a destination address source address and port numbers.
4 It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet.
5 This precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination but means that much more information is needed in the packet header which is therefore larger and this information needs to be looked up in powerhungry contentaddressable memory.
6 Each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes potentially the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connectionoriented system has to do in connection setup but with less information as to the applications requirements.
7 At the destination the original messagedata is reassembled in the correct order based on the packet sequence number.
8 Thus a virtual connection also known as a virtual circuit or byte stream is provided to the enduser by a transport layer protocol although intermediate network nodes only provides a connectionless network layer service.
9 What does each packet includ in connectionless mode 	each packet includes complete addressing information 	1.
10 How are the packets routed 	individually sometimes resulting in different paths and outoforder delivery 	2.
11 What is included with each packet label	Each packet is labeled with a destination address source address and port numbers It may also be labeled with the sequence number of the packet 	3.
12 What happens to the packet at the destination	the original messagedata is reassembled in the correct order based on the packet sequence number 	7.
1 Connectionoriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication.
2 The packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking.
3 Address information is only transferred to each node during the connection setup phase when the route to the destination is discovered and an entry is added to the switching table in each network node through which the connection passes.
4 The signaling protocols used allow the application to specify its requirements and discover link parameters.
5 Acceptable values for service parameters may be negotiated.
6 Routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table.
7 The packet header can be small as it only needs to contain this code and any information such as length timestamp or sequence number which is different for different packets.

1 Both X25 and Frame Relay provide connectionoriented operations.
2 But X25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model.
3 Frame Relay does it at level two the data link layer.
4 Another major difference between X25 and Frame Relay is that X25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted.
5 Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes.
6 X25 does not define any operations inside the packet network.
7 It only operates at the usernetworkinterface UNI.
8 Thus the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network.
9 X25 does specify some limited retransmission procedures at the UNI and its link layer protocol LAPB provides conventional HDLCtype link management procedures.
10 Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDNs layer two protocol LAPD and LAPB.
11 As such its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link not endtoend.
12 Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols.
13 The X25 UNI protocol is part of the X25 protocol suite which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model.
14 It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks.
15 Some implementations used X25 within the network as well but its connectionoriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient.
16 Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model.
17 However its address field the Data Link Connection ID or DLCI can be used at the OSI network layer with a minimum set of procedures.
18 Thus it rids itself of many X25 layer 3 encumbrances but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a nodetonode layer two link protocol.
19 The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X25.
20 Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol like X25 it does not define internal network routing operations.
21 For X25 its packet IDsthe virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses.
22 The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI.
23 How this is done is up to the network provider.
24 Frame Relay by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connectionoriented at layer two by using the HDLCLAPDLAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode SABM.
25 X25 connections are typically established for each communication session but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connectionoriented handshake.
26 For a while Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks.
27 However X25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol IP at the network layer and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM and or versions of MultiProtocol Label Switching MPLS at layer two.
28 A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS.

1 ARPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969.
2 Before the introduction of X25 in 1973 about twenty different network technologies had been developed.
3 Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core.
4 In the datagram system the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets.
5 The User Datagram Protocol UDP is an example of a datagram protocol.
6 In the virtual call system the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host.
7 This results in a simpler host interface with less functionality than in the datagram model.
8 The X25 protocol suite uses this network type.

1 The CYCLADES packet switching network was a French research network designed and directed by Louis Pouzin.
2 First demonstrated in 1973 it was developed to explore alternatives to the early ARPANET design and to support network research generally.
3 It was the first network to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data rather than the network itself using unreliable datagrams and associated endtoend protocol mechanisms.
4 Concepts of this network influenced later ARPANET architecture.

1 Merit Network Inc an independent nonprofit 501c3 corporation governed by Michigans public universities was formed in 1966 as the Michigan Educational Research Information Triad to explore computer networking between three of Michigans public universities as a means to help the states educational and economic development.
2 With initial support from the State of Michigan and the National Science Foundation NSF the packetswitched network was first demonstrated in December 1971 when an interactive host to host connection was made between the IBM mainframe computer systems at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Wayne State University in Detroit.
3 In October 1972 connections to the CDC mainframe at Michigan State University in East Lansing completed the triad.
4 Over the next several years in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal to host connections host to host batch connections remote job submission remote printing batch file transfer interactive file transfer gateways to the Tymnet and Telenet public data networks X25 host attachments gateways to X25 data networks Ethernet attached hosts and eventually TCPIP and additional public universities in Michigan join the network.

3 He had tried to interest ATT in buying the technology but the monopolys reaction was that this was incompatible with their future.
4 Bolt Beranack and Newman BBN provided the financing.
5 It initially used ARPANET technology but changed the host interface to X25 and the terminal interface to X29.

1 Tymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in San Jose CA that utilized virtual call packet switched technology and used X25 SNASDLC BSC and ASCII interfaces to connect host computers serversat thousands of large companies educational institutions and government agencies.
2 Users typically connected via dialup connections or dedicated async connections.
3 The business consisted of a large public network that supported dialup users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies mostly banks and airlines to build their own dedicated networks.
4 The private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network.
5 Tymnet was also connected to dozens of other public networks in the US and internationally via X25X75 gateways.

1 There were two kinds of X25 networks.
2 Some such as DATAPAC and TRANSPAC were initially implemented with an X25 external interface.
3 Some older networks such as TELENET and TYMNET were modified to provide a X25 host interface in addition to older host connection schemes.
4 DATAPAC was developed by Bell Northern Research which was a joint venture of Bell Canada a common carrier and Northern Telecom a telecommunications equipment supplier.
5 Northern Telecom sold several DATAPAC clones to foreign PTTs including the Deutsche Bundespost.
6 X75 and X121 allowed the interconnection of national X25 networks.
7 A user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the DNIC of the remote network as part of the destination address.

1 The Black Death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of Central Asia where it then travelled along the Silk Road reaching Crimea by 1343.
2 From there it was most likely carried by Oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships.
3 Spreading throughout the Mediterranean and Europe the Black Death is estimated to have killed 30–60 of Europes total population.
4 In total the plague reduced the world population from an estimated 450 million down to 350–375 million in the 14th century.

1 The plague disease caused by Yersinia pestis is enzootic commonly present in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents including marmots in various areas including Central Asia Kurdistan Western Asia Northern India and Uganda.
2 Nestorian graves dating to 1338–39 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic from which it could easily have spread to China and India.
3 In October 2010 medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China.
4 In China the 13th century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading.
5 However economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th century.
6 In the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine starting in 1331 with a deadly plague arriving soon after.

1 Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via Genoese traders at the port city of Kaffa in the Crimea in 1347.
2 After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army under Jani Beg was suffering from the disease the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants.
3 The Genoese traders fled taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe whence it spread north.

2 It was introduced in Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at Askøy then spread to Bjørgvin modern Bergen and Iceland.
3 Finally it spread to northwestern Russia in 1351.

1 The plague struck various countries in the Middle East during the pandemic leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures.
2 As it spread to western Europe the disease entered the region from southern Russia also.
3 By autumn 1347 the plague reached Alexandria in Egypt probably through the ports trade with Constantinople and ports on the Black Sea.
4 During 1347 the disease travelled eastward to Gaza and north along the eastern coast to cities in Lebanon Syria and Palestine including Ashkelon Acre Jerusalem Sidon Damascus Homs and Aleppo.
5 In 1348–49 the disease reached Antioch.
6 The citys residents fled to the north most of them dying during the journey but the infection had been spread to the people of Asia Minor.

1 Medical knowledge had stagnated during the Middle Ages.
2 The most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in Paris in a report to the king of France that blamed the heavens in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a great pestilence in the air.
3 This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of plague tracts that sought to give advice to sufferers.
4 That the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory.
5 Today this is known as the Miasma theory.
6 The word plague had no special significance at this time and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term.
7 What was the black death originally blamed on?	the heavens	2

1 The dominant explanation for the Black Death is the plague theory which attributes the outbreak to Yersinia pestis also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865 eventually spreading to India.
2 The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19thcentury plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894 among whom was the FrenchSwiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin after whom the pathogen was named Yersinia pestis.
3 The mechanism by which Y pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by PaulLouis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y pestis several days after feeding on an infected host.
4 This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site infecting the host.
5 The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents one resistant to the disease which act as hosts keeping the disease endemic and a second that lack resistance.
6 When the second population dies the fleas move on to other hosts including people thus creating a human epidemic.

1 The historian Francis Aidan Gasquet wrote about the Great Pestilence in 1893 and suggested that it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague.
2 He was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the Black Death for the second edition in 1908 implicating rats and fleas in the process and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics such as the Justinian plague that was prevalent in the Eastern Roman Empire from 541 to 700 CE.

1 Other forms of plague have been implicated by modern scientists.
2 The modern bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30–75 and symptoms including fever of 38–41 °C 100–106 °F headaches painful aching joints nausea and vomiting and a general feeling of malaise.
3 Left untreated of those that contract the bubonic plague 80 percent die within eight days.
4 Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent.
5 Symptoms include fever cough and bloodtinged sputum.
6 As the disease progresses sputum becomes free flowing and bright red.
7 Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms with a mortality rate near 100.
8 Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation.
9 In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.

1 In October 2010 the openaccess scientific journal PLoS Pathogens published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of Yersinia pestis in the Black Death following the disputed identification by Drancourt and Raoult in 1998.
2 They assessed the presence of DNARNA with Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR techniques for Y pestis from the tooth sockets in human skeletons from mass graves in northern central and southern Europe that were associated archaeologically with the Black Death and subsequent resurgences.
3 The authors concluded that this new research together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany .

11 What does the plos pathogen paper claim?	unambiguously demonstrates that Y pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague	6
1 The study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades genetic branches of the Y pestis genome associated with medieval mass graves.
2 These clades which are thought to be extinct were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern Y pestis strains Y p orientalis and Y p medievalis suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves.
3 Surveys of plague pit remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of Marseille around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349 where it spread through the country in three epidemics.
4 Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of Bergen op Zoom showed the Y pestis genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France implying Bergen op Zoom and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague different from those in Britain and France may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway the Hanseatic cities or another site.

1 The plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J F D Shrewsbury in 1970 who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14thcentury pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.
2 In 1984 zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors including Samuel K Cohn Jr 2002 David Herlihy 1997 and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan 2001.

1 It is recognised that an epidemiological account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period.
2 Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100 as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377.
3 Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.

8 During which years was no census taken?	between the time of publication of the Domesday Book and the year 1377	2
1 In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere despite extensive samples from other mass graves.
2 Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas that despite primitive transport systems the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high that while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas and that the pattern of the Black Death with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flareups.
3 Why might rats not be responsible for the plague?	the rat population was insufficient	1
4 How significant was the transfer of disease through fleas?	of marginal significance	1

7 How many years could separate outbreaks of the black death?	5 to 15 years	2
1 A variety of alternatives to the Y pestis have been put forward.
2 Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of anthrax and Norman Cantor 2001 thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics.
3 Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola.
4 Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y pestis was spread from fleas on rats he argues that transmission must have been person to person.
5 However no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance.
6 Many scholars arguing for the Y pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases including typhus smallpox and respiratory infections.
7 In addition to the bubonic infection others point to additional septicemic a type of blood poisoning and pneumonic an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body forms of the plague which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.
8 In 2014 scientists with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London as well as of wills registered in London during the period which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.

1 The most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East including Iraq Iran and Syria during this time is for a death rate of about a third.
2 The Black Death killed about 40 of Egypts population.
3 Half of Pariss population of 100000 people died.
4 In Italy the population of Florence was reduced from 110–120 thousand inhabitants in 1338 down to 50 thousand in 1351.
5 At least 60 of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well.
6 Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found wellpreserved individuals to be buried in isolated evenly spaced graves suggesting at least some preplanning and Christian burials at this time.
7 Before 1350 there were about 170000 settlements in Germany and this was reduced by nearly 40000 by 1450.

1 There are three major types of rock igneous sedimentary and metamorphic.
2 The rock cycle is an important concept in geology which illustrates the relationships between these three types of rock and magma.
3 When a rock crystallizes from melt magma andor lava it is an igneous rock.
4 This rock can be weathered and eroded and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric.
5 The sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered eroded deposited and lithified ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock.
6 Sedimentary rock may also be reeroded and redeposited and metamorphic rock may also undergo additional metamorphism.
7 All three types of rocks may be remelted when this happens a new magma is formed from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize.
8 An igneous rock is a rock that crystallizes from what?	melt magma andor lava	3

1 In the 1960s a series of discoveries the most important of which was seafloor spreading showed that the Earths lithosphere which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle is separated into a number of tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming solid upper mantle which is called the asthenosphere.
2 There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the mantle oceanic plate motions and mantle convection currents always move in the same direction because the oceanic lithosphere is the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle.
3 This coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics.

7 Plate tectonics can be seen as the intimate coupling between rigid plates on the surface of the Earth and what?	the convecting mantle	3
8 In what decade was seafloor spreading discovered?	the 1960s	1
1 The development of plate tectonics provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth.
2 Long linear regions of geologic features could be explained as plate boundaries.
3 Midocean ridges high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist were explained as divergent boundaries where two plates move apart.
4 Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries where one plate subducts under another.
5 Transform boundaries such as the San Andreas fault system resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes.
6 Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegeners theory of continental drift in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time.
7 They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation and a new setting for the observations of structural geology.
8 The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.

1 Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth.
2 Early advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core where shear waves were not able to propagate and a dense solid inner core.
3 These advances led to the development of a layered model of the Earth with a crust and lithosphere on top the mantle below separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers and the outer core and inner core below that.
4 More recently seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a doctor images a body in a CT scan.

1 The following four timelines show the geologic time scale.
2 The first shows the entire time from the formation of the Earth to the present but this compresses the most recent eon.
3 Therefore the second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale.
4 The second scale compresses the most recent era so the most recent era is expanded in the third scale.
5 Since the Quaternary is a very short period with short epochs it is further expanded in the fourth scale.
6 The second third and fourth timelines are therefore each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks.
7 The Holocene the latest epoch is too small to be shown clearly on the third timeline on the right another reason for expanding the fourth scale.
8 The Pleistocene P epoch.
9 Q stands for the Quaternary period.
10 Why is the second timeline needed?	second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale	3
11 Which timeline is further expanded in the fourth scale?	Quaternary	5
12 What is the name of the latest epoch?	The Holocene	7
13 The Pleistocene epoch takes place during which period?	the Quaternary period	9
1 The principle of crosscutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut.
2 Faults are younger than the rocks they cut accordingly if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it then the formations that were cut are older than the fault and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault.
3 Finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.
4 What principle relates to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut?	The principle of crosscutting relationships	1
5 When rock formations are found on top of a fault that have not been cut then they must be older or younger than the fault?	younger than the fault	2
6 Finding what helps to determine if a fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault?	the key bed	3
7 Rocks on top of a fault that are cut are always older or younger than the fault itself?	older than the fault	2
1 The principle of inclusions and components states that with sedimentary rocks if inclusions or clasts are found in a formation then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them.
2 For example in sedimentary rocks it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer.
3 A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found.
4 These foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows and are incorporated later to cool in the matrix.
5 As a result xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them.
6 What foreign bodies which are older than the rocks themselves occur igneous rocks?	xenoliths	5
7 Xenoliths are picked up by what and deposited into the matrix of igneous rocks?	magma or lava flows	4
8 What is another word for inclusions in sedimentary rocks?	clasts	1
9 What is the principle that states that with sedimentary rocks inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them?	The principle of inclusions and components	1
10 What is something that is often torn up and included in sedimentary rock?	gravel	2
1 The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks.
2 As organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world their presence or sometimes absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found.
3 Based on principles laid out by William Smith almost a hundred years before the publication of Charles Darwins theory of evolution the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought.
4 The principle becomes quite complex however given the uncertainties of fossilization the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat facies change in sedimentary strata and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time.
5 Which principle is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks?	The principle of faunal succession	1
6 Whose principles were the principle of faunal succession built upon?	William Smith	3
7 The fact that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time causes the principle to become what?	complex	4
8 The presence or absence of what can be used to determine the relative age of the formations in which they are found?	organisms	2
9 The principle of faunal succession was developed 100 years before whose theory of evolution?	Charles Darwin	3
1 At the beginning of the 20th century important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods.
2 This changed the understanding of geologic time.
3 Previously geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another.
4 With isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.
5 When was the ability to use radioactive isotopes to date rock formations developed?	At the beginning of the 20th century	1
6 What type of correlation was used previously to help date rock formations?	stratigraphic correlation	3
7 It is now possible to convert old relative ages into what type of ages using isotopic dating?	absolute ages	4
8 Previous to isotopic dating sections of rocks had to be dated using fossils and stratigraphic correlation relative to what?	to one another	3
9 When dating rocks what is the absolute isotopic date applied to?	fossil sequences	4
1 For many geologic applications isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice.
2 These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies.
3 Common methods include uraniumlead dating potassiumargon dating argonargon dating and uraniumthorium dating.
4 These methods are used for a variety of applications.
5 Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques.
6 These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement.
7 Thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust the uplift of mountain ranges and paleotopography.

1 When rock units are placed under horizontal compression they shorten and become thicker.
2 Because rock units other than muds do not significantly change in volume this is accomplished in two primary ways through faulting and folding.
3 In the shallow crust where brittle deformation can occur thrust faults form which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock.
4 Because deeper rock is often older as noted by the principle of superposition this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones.
5 Movement along faults can result in folding either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault.
6 Deeper in the Earth rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting.
7 These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards creating antiforms or where it buckles downwards creating synforms.
8 If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards they are called anticlines and synclines respectively.
9 If some of the units in the fold are facing downward the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct updirection is unknown they are simply called by the most general terms antiforms and synforms.
10 Rock units become thicker and shorten when placed under this type of compression 	horizontal compression 	1.
11 Where do thrust faults form?	In the shallow crust	3
12 When rock folds deep in the Earth it can fold one of two ways when it buckles upwards it creates what?	antiforms	7

14 If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards they are called what?	anticlines and synclines	8
1 Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner.
2 This is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning.
3 Normal faults drop rock units that are higher below those that are lower.
4 This typically results in younger units being placed below older units.
5 Stretching of units can result in their thinning in fact there is a location within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter.
6 Rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed.
7 These stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses known as boudins after the French word for sausage because of their visual similarity.
8 This causes the rock unit as a whole to become longer and thinner 	Extension 	1.
9 Stretched rocks that pinch into lenses are known by what word?	boudins	7
10 Where can the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon be seen in less than the length of a meter?	within the Maria Fold and Thrust Belt	5
11 Rocks that are a depth where they are ductilely stretched are also often what?	metamorphosed	6
12 What causes rock extension?	normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning	2
1 The addition of new rock units both depositionally and intrusively often occurs during deformation.
2 Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels.
3 These sediments are deposited on the rock unit that is going down.
4 Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit.
5 Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity.
6 Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface and igneous intrusions enter from below.
7 Dikes long planar igneous intrusions enter along cracks and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed.
8 This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano.

1 All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment and do not necessarily occur in a single order.
2 The Hawaiian Islands for example consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows.
3 The sedimentary sequences of the midcontinental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almostundeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time.
4 Other areas are much more geologically complex.
5 In the southwestern United States sedimentary volcanic and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed faulted foliated and folded.
6 Even older rocks such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis.
7 In addition these processes can occur in stages.
8 In many places the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed and then deformation ended and the upper undeformed units were deposited.
9 Although any amount of rock emplacement and rock deformation can occur and they can occur any number of times these concepts provide a guide to understanding the geological history of an area.

1 Among the most wellknown experiments in structural geology are those involving orogenic wedges which are zones in which mountains are built along convergent tectonic plate boundaries.
2 In the analog versions of these experiments horizontal layers of sand are pulled along a lower surface into a back stop which results in realisticlooking patterns of faulting and the growth of a critically tapered all angles remain the same orogenic wedge.
3 Numerical models work in the same way as these analog models though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt.
4 This helps to show the relationship between erosion and the shape of the mountain range.

1 Some modern scholars such as Fielding H Garrison are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end.
2 Abu alRayhan alBiruni 973–1048 CE was one of the earliest Persian geologists whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea.
3 Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests the Persian scholar Ibn Sina Avicenna 981–1037 proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains the origin of earthquakes and other topics central to modern geology which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science.
4 In China the polymath Shen Kuo 1031–1095 formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.

1 The first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle was Pons Aelius a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne.
2 It was given the family name of the Roman Emperor Hadrian who founded it in the 2nd century AD.
3 This rare honour suggests that Hadrian may have visited the site and instituted the bridge on his tour of Britain.
4 The population of Pons Aelius at this period was estimated at 2000.
5 Fragments of Hadrians Wall are still visible in parts of Newcastle particularly along the West Road.
6 The course of the Roman Wall can be traced eastwards to the Segedunum Roman fort in Wallsend—the walls end—and to the supply fort Arbeia in South Shields.
7 The extent of Hadrians Wall was 73 miles 117 km spanning the width of Britain the Wall incorporated the Vallum a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds and was constructed primarily for defence to prevent unwanted immigration and the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north not as a fighting line for a major invasion.

1 From 1530 a royal act restricted all shipments of coal from Tyneside to Newcastle Quayside giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of Newcastle burgesses known as the Hostmen.
2 This monopoly which lasted for a considerable time helped Newcastle prosper and develop into a major town.
3 The phrase taking coals to Newcastle was first recorded contextually in 1538.
4 The phrase itself means a pointless pursuit.
5 In the 18th century American Timothy Dexter an entrepreneur widely regarded as an eccentric defied this idiom.

1 In the Sandgate area to the east of the city and beside the river resided the closeknit community of keelmen and their families.
2 They were so called because they worked on the keels boats that were used to transfer coal from the river banks to the waiting colliers for export to London and elsewhere.
3 In the 1630s about 7000 out of 20000 inhabitants of Newcastle died of plague more than onethird of the population.

1 The VA has its origins in the Great Exhibition of 1851 with which Henry Cole the museums first director was involved in planning initially it was known as the Museum of Manufactures first opening in May 1852 at Marlborough House but by September had been transferred to Somerset House.
2 At this stage the collections covered both applied art and science.
3 Several of the exhibits from the Exhibition were purchased to form the nucleus of the collection.
4 By February 1854 discussions were underway to transfer the museum to the current site and it was renamed South Kensington Museum.
5 In 1855 the German architect Gottfried Semper at the request of Cole produced a design for the museum but it was rejected by the Board of Trade as too expensive.
6 The site was occupied by Brompton Park House this was extended including the first refreshment rooms opened in 1857 the museum being the first in the world to provide such a facility.

3 This was to enable in the words of Cole to ascertain practically what hours are most convenient to the working classes—this was linked to the use of the collections of both applied art and science as educational resources to help boost productive industry.
4 In these early years the practical use of the collection was very much emphasised as opposed to that of High Art at the National Gallery and scholarship at the British Museum.
5 George Wallis 1811–1891 the first Keeper of Fine Art Collection passionately promoted the idea of wide art education through the museum collections.
6 This led to the transfer to the museum of the School of Design that had been founded in 1837 at Somerset House after the transfer it was referred to as the Art School or Art Training School later to become the Royal College of Art which finally achieved full independence in 1949.
7 From the 1860s to the 1880s the scientific collections had been moved from the main museum site to various improvised galleries to the west of Exhibition Road.
8 In 1893 the Science Museum had effectively come into existence when a separate director was appointed.

1 The Victorian parts of the building have a complex history with piecemeal additions by different architects.
2 Founded in May 1852 it was not until 1857 that the museum moved to the present site.
3 This area of London was known as Brompton but had been renamed South Kensington.
4 The land was occupied by Brompton Park House which was extended most notably by the Brompton Boilers which were starkly utilitarian iron galleries with a temporary look and were later dismantled and used to build the VA Museum of Childhood.
5 The first building to be erected that still forms part of the museum was the Sheepshanks Gallery in 1857 on the eastern side of the garden.
6 Its architect was civil engineer Captain Francis Fowke Royal Engineers who was appointed by Cole.
7 The next major expansions were designed by the same architect the Turner and Vernon galleries built 18589 to house the eponymous collections later transferred to the Tate Gallery and now used as the picture galleries and tapestry gallery respectively.
8 The North and South Courts were then built both of which opened by June 1862.
9 They now form the galleries for temporary exhibitions and are directly behind the Sheepshanks Gallery.
10 On the very northern edge of the site is situated the Secretariat Wing also built in 1862 this houses the offices and board room etc.

1 An ambitious scheme of decoration was developed for these new areas a series of mosaic figures depicting famous European artists of the Medieval and Renaissance period.
2 These have now been removed to other areas of the museum.
3 Also started were a series of frescoes by Lord Leighton Industrial Arts as Applied to War 1878–1880 and Industrial Arts Applied to Peace which was started but never finished.
4 To the east of this were additional galleries the decoration of which was the work of another designer Owen Jones these were the Oriental Courts covering India China and Japan completed in 1863 none of this decoration survives part of these galleries became the new galleries covering the 19th century opened in December 2006.
5 The last work by Fowke was the design for the range of buildings on the north and west sides of the garden this includes the refreshment rooms reinstated as the Museum Café in 2006 with the silver gallery above at the time the ceramics gallery the top floor has a splendid lecture theatre although this is seldom open to the general public.
6 The ceramic staircase in the northwest corner of this range of buildings was designed by F W Moody and has architectural details of moulded and coloured pottery.
7 All the work on the north range was designed and built in 1864–69.
8 The style adopted for this part of the museum was Italian Renaissance much use was made of terracotta brick and mosaic this north façade was intended as the main entrance to the museum with its bronze doors designed by James Gamble  Reuben Townroe having six panels depicting Humphry Davy chemistry Isaac Newton astronomy James Watt mechanics Bramante architecture Michelangelo sculpture Titian painting thus representing the range of the museums collections Godfrey Sykes also designed the terracotta embellishments and the mosaic in the pediment of the North Façade commemorating the Great Exhibition the profits from which helped to fund the museum this is flanked by terracotta statue groups by Percival Ball.

1 Continuing the style of the earlier buildings various designers were responsible for the decoration the terracotta embellishments were again the work of Godfrey Sykes although sgraffito was used to decorate the east side of the building designed by F W Moody a final embellishment were the wrought iron gates made as late as 1885 designed by Starkie Gardner these lead to a passage through the building.
2 Scott also designed the two Cast Courts 1870–73 to the southeast of the garden the site of the Brompton Boilers these vast spaces have ceilings 70 feet 21 m in height to accommodate the plaster casts of parts of famous buildings including Trajans Column in two separate pieces.
3 The final part of the museum designed by Scott was the Art Library and what is now the sculpture gallery on the south side of the garden built 1877–83 the exterior mosaic panels in the parapet were designed by Reuben Townroe who also designed the plaster work in the library Sir John Taylor designed the book shelves and cases also this was the first part of the museum to have electric lighting.
4 This completed the northern half of the site creating a quadrangle with the garden at its centre but left the museum without a proper façade.

2 Construction took place between 1899 and 1909.
3 Stylistically it is a strange hybrid although much of the detail belongs to the Renaissance there are medieval influences at work.
4 The main entrance consisting of a series of shallow arches supported by slender columns and niches with twin doors separated by pier is Romanesque in form but Classical in detail.
5 Likewise the tower above the main entrance has an open work crown surmounted by a statue of fame a feature of late Gothic architecture and a feature common in Scotland but the detail is Classical.

1 In the immediate postwar years there was little money available for other than essential repairs.
2 The 1950s and early 1960s saw little in the way of building work the first major work was the creation of new storage space for books in the Art Library in 1966 and 1967.
3 This involved flooring over Aston Webbs main hall to form the book stacks with a new medieval gallery on the ground floor now the shop opened in 2006.
4 Then the lower groundfloor galleries in the southwest part of the museum were redesigned opening in 1978 to form the new galleries covering Continental art 1600–1800 late Renaissance Baroque through Rococo and neoClassical.
5 In 1974 the museum had acquired what is now the Henry Cole wing from the Royal College of Science.
6 In order to adapt the building as galleries all the Victorian interiors except for the staircase were recast during the remodelling.

1 The Victoria and Albert Museum’s Word and Image Department was under the same pressure being felt in archives around the world to digitize their collection.
2 A large scale digitization project began in 2007 in that department.
3 That project was entitled the Factory Project to reference Andy Warhol and to create a factory to completely digitize the collection.
4 The first step of the Factory Project was to take photographs utilizing digital cameras.
5 The Word and Image Department had a collection of old photos but they were in black and white and in variant conditions so new photos were shot.
6 Those new photographs will be accessible to researchers to the Victoria and Albert Museum website.
7 15000 images were taken during the first year of the Factory Project including drawings watercolors computergenerated art photographs posters and woodcuts.
8 The second step of the Factory Project is to catalog everything.

10 All of those items which were photographed and cataloged must be audited to make sure everything listed as being in the collection was physically found during the creation of the Factory Project.
11 The fourth goal of the Factory Project is conservation which means performing some basic preventable procedures to those items in the department.

1 By 1954 all US networks had regained control of their programming with higher advertising revenues ABCs revenue increased by 67 earning 26 million NBCs went up by 30 100 million and CBSs rose by 44 117 million.
2 However that year ABC had only 14 primary affiliates compared to the 74 that carried the majority of CBS programs and the 71 that were primarily affiliated with NBC.
3 Most markets outside the largest ones were not large enough to support three fulltime network affiliates.
4 In some markets that were large enough for a third fulltime affiliate the only available commercial allocation was on the lessdesirable UHF band.
5 Until the AllChannel Receiver Act passed by Congress in 1961 mandated the inclusion of UHF tuning most viewers needed to purchase a converter to be able to watch UHF stations and the signal quality was marginal at best even with a converter.
6 Additionally during the analog television era UHF stations were not adequately receivable in rugged terrain.
7 These factors made many prospective station owners skittish about investing in a UHF station especially one that would have had to take on an affiliation with a weaker network.
8 How many primary affiliates did ABC have in 1954?	14	2
9 How many primary affiliates did CBS have in 1954?	74	2
10 What important legislation was passed by Congress for the television industry in 1961?	AllChannel Receiver Act	5

1 As a result with the exception of the largest markets ABC was relegated to secondary status on one or both of the existing stations usually via offhours clearances a notable exception during this time was WKSTTV in Youngstown Ohio now WYTV despite the small size of the surrounding market and its close proximity to Cleveland and Pittsburgh even decades before the citys economic collapse.
2 According to Goldenson this meant that an hour of ABC programming reported five times lower viewership than its competitors.
3 However the networks intake of money at the time would allow it to accelerate its content production.
4 Still ABCs limited reach would continue to hobble it for the next two decades several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a fulltime ABC affiliate until the 1960s with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s which allowed stations like WTRFTV in Wheeling West Virginia to begin airing ABC programming on a digital subchannel after airing the networks programs outside of recommended timeslots decades before.
5 ABC had secondary status on the existing stations in what Ohio town?	Youngstown	1
6 Relegation to secondary status for ABC resulted in viewership how much lower than their competitors according to Goldenson?	five times lower viewership	2
7 The beginnings of digital television allowed what affiliate in Wheeling West Virginia to begin airing ABC programs digitally?	WTRFTV	4
8 Very small markets had to wait until what decade to support an ABC affiliate?	1980s	4

2 Genghis Khan decided to conquer the Qara Khitai and defeat Kuchlug possibly to take him out of power.
3 By this time the Mongol army was exhausted from ten years of continuous campaigning in China against the Western Xia and Jin dynasty.

2 As a result Kuchlugs army was defeated west of Kashgar.
3 Kuchlug fled again but was soon hunted down by Jebes army and executed.
4 By 1218 as a result of defeat of Qara Khitai the Mongol Empire and its control extended as far west as Lake Balkhash which bordered the Khwarezmia Khwarezmid Empire a Muslim state that reached the Caspian Sea to the west and Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea to the south.

2 Genghis Khan saw the potential advantage in Khwarezmia as a commercial trading partner using the Silk Road and he initially sent a 500man caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire.
3 However Inalchuq the governor of the Khwarezmian city of Otrar attacked the caravan that came from Mongolia claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against Khwarezmia.
4 The situation became further complicated because the governor later refused to make repayments for the looting of the caravans and handing over the perpetrators.
5 Genghis Khan then sent again a second group of three ambassadors two Mongols and a Muslim to meet the Shah himself instead of the governor Inalchuq.
6 The Shah had all the men shaved and the Muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors.
7 This was seen as an affront and insult to Genghis Khan.
8 Outraged Genghis Khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100000 soldiers 10 tumens his most capable generals and some of his sons.

1 The Shahs army was split by diverse internecine feuds and by the Shahs decision to divide his army into small groups concentrated in various cities.
2 This fragmentation was decisive in Khwarezmias defeats as it allowed the Mongols although exhausted from the long journey to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the Khwarzemi forces instead of facing a unified defense.
3 The Mongol army quickly seized the town of Otrar relying on superior strategy and tactics.

3 Genghis Khan led the main army on a raid through Afghanistan and northern India towards Mongolia while another 20000 two tumen contingent marched through the Caucasus and into Russia under generals Jebe and Subutai.
4 They pushed deep into Armenia and Azerbaijan.
5 The Mongols destroyed the kingdom of Georgia sacked the Genoese tradefortress of Caffa in Crimea and overwintered near the Black Sea.
6 Heading home Subutais forces attacked the allied forces of the Cuman–Kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80000 Kievan Rus troops led by Mstislav the Bold of Halych and Mstislav III of Kiev who went out to stop the Mongols actions in the area.
7 Subutai sent emissaries to the Slavic princes calling for a separate peace but the emissaries were executed.
8 At the Battle of Kalka River in 1223 Subutais forces defeated the larger Kievan force.
9 They also may have fought against the neighboring Volga Bulgars.
10 There is no historical record except a short account by the Arab historian Ibn alAthir writing in Mosul some 1100 miles away from the event.
11 Various historical secondary sources  Morgan Chambers Grousset  state that the Mongols actually defeated the Bulgars Chambers even going so far as to say that the Bulgars had made up stories to tell the recently crushed Russians that they had beaten the Mongols and driven them from their territory.
12 The Russian princes then sued for peace.
13 Subutai agreed but was in no mood to pardon the princes.
14 As was customary in Mongol society for nobility the Russian princes were given a bloodless death.
15 Subutai had a large wooden platform constructed on which he ate his meals along with his other generals.

3 The famous cavalry expedition led by Subutai and Jebe in which they encircled the entire Caspian Sea defeating all armies in their path remains unparalleled to this day and word of the Mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations particularly Europe.
4 These two campaigns are generally regarded as reconnaissance campaigns that tried to get the feel of the political and cultural elements of the regions.
5 In 1225 both divisions returned to Mongolia.
6 These invasions added Transoxiana and Persia to an already formidable empire while destroying any resistance along the way.

1 The succession of Genghis Khan was already a significant topic during the later years of his reign as he reached old age.
2 The long running paternity discussion about Genghis oldest son Jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of Jochi among the brothers.
3 According to traditional historical accounts the issue over Jochis paternity was voiced most strongly by Chagatai.
4 In The Secret History of the Mongols just before the invasion of the Khwarezmid Empire by Genghis Khan Chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept Jochi as Genghis Khans successor.
5 In response to this tension and possibly for other reasons Ögedei was appointed as successor.
6 The paternity of which of Genghis Khans sons was disputed?	Jochi	2
7 Which Mongol leader was most opposed to Jochi as Genghis Khans successor?	Chagatai	4
8 Before which military campaign did Chagatai publicly dispute Jochis paternity?	invasion of the Khwarezmid Empire	4
9 Who was appointed Genghis Khans successor?	Ögedei	5
1 Genghis Khan was aware of the friction between his sons particularly between Chagatai and Jochi and worried of possible conflict between them if he died.
2 He therefore decided to divide his empire among his sons and make all of them Khan in their own right while appointing one of his sons as his successor.
3 Chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior because of statements he made that he would not follow Jochi if he were to become his fathers successor.
4 Tolui Genghis Khans youngest son was not to be his successor because he was the youngest and in the Mongol culture youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age.
5 If Jochi were to become successor it was likely that Chagatai would engage in warfare with him and collapse the empire.
6 Therefore Genghis Khan decided to give the throne to Ögedei.
7 Ögedei was seen by Genghis Khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate and might defuse the situation between his brothers.
8 Which pair of Genghis Khans sons were most rivalrous?	Chagatai and Jochi	1
9 Which of Genghis Khans sons was disqualified from being successor because of his unstable behavior?	Chagatai	3
10 Whichs of Genghis Khans successors could not be successor because of his age?	Tolui	4
11 Which son did Genghis Khan view as his most dependable one?	Ögedei	7
1 Jochi died in 1226 during his fathers lifetime.
2 Some scholars notably Ratchnevsky have commented on the possibility that Jochi was secretly poisoned by an order from Genghis Khan.
3 Rashid alDin reports that the great Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223 and while his brothers heeded the order Jochi remained in Khorasan.
4 Juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between Jochi and his brothers in the siege of Urgench.
5 Jochi had attempted to protect Urgench from destruction as it belonged to territory allocated to him as a fief.
6 He concludes his story with the clearly apocryphal statement by Jochi Genghis Khan is mad to have massacred so many people and laid waste so many lands.
7 I would be doing a service if I killed my father when he is hunting made an alliance with Sultan Muhammad brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the Muslims.
8 Juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that Genghis Khan ordered his son secretly poisoned however as Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223 the accuracy of this story is questionable.
9 Jochis death occurred in what year?	1226	1
10 Where did Jochi remain after Genghis Khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223?	Khorasan	3
11 Which territory did Jochi try to protect that may have led to a dispute with his brothers?	Urgench	4
12 Who did Jochi reportedly enlist to help him stop his fathers massacres?	Sultan Muhammad	7
13 Why is Jochis reported alliance with the Muslims historically suspect?	Sultan Muhammad was already dead in 1223	8
1 In August 1227 during the fall of Yinchuan the capital of Western Xia Genghis Khan died.

4 He was already old and tired from his journeys.
5 The Galician–Volhynian Chronicle alleges he was killed by the Western Xia in battle while Marco Polo wrote that he died after the infection of an arrow wound he received during his final campaign.
6 Later Mongol chronicles connect Genghis death with a Western Xia princess taken as war booty.
7 One chronicle from the early 17th century even relates the legend that the princess hid a small dagger and stabbed him though some Mongol authors have doubted this version and suspected it to be an invention by the rival Oirads.

2 However there is no evidence of this or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the Chinese.
3 Women played a relatively important role in Mongol Empire and in family for example Töregene Khatun was briefly in charge of the Mongol Empire when next male Khagan was being chosen.

1 Genghis Khan realised that he needed people who could govern cities and states conquered by him.
2 He also realised that such administrators could not be found among his Mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities.
3 For this purpose Genghis Khan invited a Khitan prince ChuTsai who worked for the Jin and had been captured by the Mongol army after the Jin dynasty was defeated.
4 Jin had captured power by displacing Khitan.
5 Genghis told ChuTsai who was a lineal descendant of Khitan rulers that he had avenged ChuTsais forefathers.
6 ChuTsai responded that his father served the Jin dynasty honestly and so did he also he did not consider his own father his enemy so the question of revenge did not apply.

1 There are conflicting views of Genghis Khan in the Peoples Republic of China with some viewing him positively in the Inner Mongolia region where there are a monument and buildings about him and where there is a considerable number of Mongols in the area with a population of around 5 million almost twice the population of Mongolia.
2 While Genghis Khan never conquered all of China his grandson Kublai Khan completed that conquest and established the Yuan dynasty that is often credited with reuniting China.
3 There has been much artwork and literature praising Genghis as a great military leader and political genius.
4 The years of the Mongolestablished Yuan dynasty left an indelible imprint on Chinese political and social structures for subsequent generations with literature during the Jin dynasty relatively fewer.

1 The word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th–17th centuries.
2 However the original Greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison.
3 In addition to pharma responsibilities the pharma offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed solely by other specialist practitioners such as surgery and midwifery.
4 The pharma as it was referred to often operated through a retail shop which in addition to ingredients for medicines sold tobacco and patent medicines.
5 Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent.

3 Abu alQasim alZahrawi Abulcasis 936–1013 pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation.
4 His Liber servitoris is of particular interest as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the simples’ from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used.
5 Sabur Ibn Sahl d 869 was however the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments.
6 AlBiruni 973–1050 wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology entitled Kitab alSaydalah The Book of Drugs in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist.
7 Avicenna too described no less than 700 preparations their properties modes of action and their indications.
8 He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine.
9 Of great impact were also the works by alMaridini of Baghdad and Cairo and Ibn alWafid 1008–1074 both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by Mesue the younger and the Medicamentis simplicibus by Abenguefit.
10 Peter of Abano 1250–1316 translated and added a supplement to the work of alMaridini under the title De Veneris.
11 AlMuwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering.
12 Living in the 10th century he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies amongst others describing arsenious oxide and being acquainted with silicic acid.
13 He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds especially copper vitriol and also lead compounds.

1 In most jurisdictions such as the United States pharmacists are regulated separately from physicians.
2 These jurisdictions also usually specify that only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public and that pharmacists cannot form business partnerships with physicians or give them kickback payments.
3 However the American Medical Association AMA Code of Ethics provides that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices as long as there is no patient exploitation and patients have the right to a written prescription that can be filled elsewhere.
4 7 to 10 percent of American physicians practices reportedly dispense drugs on their own.

1 In some rural areas in the United Kingdom there are dispensing physicians who are allowed to both prescribe and dispense prescriptiononly medicines to their patients from within their practices.
2 The law requires that the GP practice be located in a designated rural area and that there is also a specified minimum distance currently 16 kilometres between a patients home and the nearest retail pharmacy.
3 This law also exists in Austria for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away or where none is registered in the city.

1 The reason for the majority rule is the high risk of a conflict of interest andor the avoidance of absolute powers.
2 Otherwise the physician has a financial selfinterest in diagnosing as many conditions as possible and in exaggerating their seriousness because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient.
3 Such selfinterest directly conflicts with the patients interest in obtaining costeffective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have sideeffects.
4 This system reflects much similarity to the checks and balances system of the US and many other governments.

1 This shift has already commenced in some countries for instance pharmacists in Australia receive remuneration from the Australian Government for conducting comprehensive Home Medicines Reviews.
2 In Canada pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights as in Alberta and British Columbia or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews Medschecks in Ontario.
3 In the United Kingdom pharmacists who undertake additional training are obtaining prescribing rights and this is because of pharmacy education.
4 They are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews.
5 In Scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their regular medications for the majority of drugs except for controlled drugs when the patient is unable to see their doctor as could happen if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailable.

1 The immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease.
2 To function properly an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents known as pathogens from viruses to parasitic worms and distinguish them from the organisms own healthy tissue.
3 In many species the immune system can be classified into subsystems such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system or humoral immunity versus cellmediated immunity.
4 In humans the blood–brain barrier blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier and similar fluid–brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain.

1 Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system however multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens.
2 Even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections.
3 Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants such as plants and invertebrates.
4 These mechanisms include phagocytosis antimicrobial peptides called defensins and the complement system.
5 Jawed vertebrates including humans have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently.
6 Adaptive or acquired immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen.
7 This process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination.

1 Immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system.
2 It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease.
3 The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC.
4 Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time.
5 In the 18th century PierreLouis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom.
6 This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease.
7 Pasteurs theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease such as the miasma theory.
8 It was not until Robert Kochs 1891 proofs for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905 that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease.
9 Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901 with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed.

1 The immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity.
2 In simple terms physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism.
3 If a pathogen breaches these barriers the innate immune system provides an immediate but nonspecific response.
4 Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals.
5 If pathogens successfully evade the innate response vertebrates possess a second layer of protection the adaptive immune system which is activated by the innate response.
6 Here the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen.
7 This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated in the form of an immunological memory and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.
8 What is another name for an immune systems improved response?	immunological memory	7
9 Which system comes after an organisms physical barriers?	the innate immune system	3
10 What protection comes after the innate response?	the adaptive immune system	5
11 What type of immune systems are found in all plants and animals?	Innate immune systems	4
12 What immune system is activated by the innate response?	adaptive immune system	5
13 What allows the adaptive immune system to react faster and more strongly each subsequent time a pathogen is encountered?	immunological memory	7
14 What is the first line of defense against pathogens that prevents them from entering an organism?	physical barriers	2
1 Both innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and nonself molecules.
2 In immunology self molecules are those components of an organisms body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system.
3 Conversely nonself molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules.
4 One class of nonself molecules are called antigens short for antibody generators and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.
5 The adaptive immune system must distinguish between what types of molecules?	self and nonself	1
6 What molecules are parts of the body of an organism in immunology?	self molecules	2
7 What molecules are recognized as foreign by the immune system?	nonself molecules	3
8 What term is shorthand for antibody generators?	antigens	4
9 Antigens bind to what in order to elicit a response of the immune system?	specific immune receptors	4
1 Microorganisms or toxins that successfully enter an organism encounter the cells and mechanisms of the innate immune system.
2 The innate response is usually triggered when microbes are identified by pattern recognition receptors which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms or when damaged injured or stressed cells send out alarm signals many of which but not all are recognized by the same receptors as those that recognize pathogens.
3 Innate immune defenses are nonspecific meaning these systems respond to pathogens in a generic way.
4 This system does not confer longlasting immunity against a pathogen.
5 The innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms.
6 What part of the innate immune system identifies microbes and triggers immune response?	pattern recognition receptors	2
7 For most organisms what is the dominant system of defense?	innate immune system	5
8 Pattern recognition receptors recognize components present in broad groups of what?	microorganisms	2
9 The innate immune system responds in a generic way meaning it is what?	nonspecific	3
1 Several barriers protect organisms from infection including mechanical chemical and biological barriers.
2 The waxy cuticle of many leaves the exoskeleton of insects the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection.
3 However as organisms cannot be completely sealed from their environments other systems act to protect body openings such as the lungs intestines and the genitourinary tract.
4 In the lungs coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract.
5 The flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms.
6 What is a mechanical barrier in insects that protects the insect?	exoskeleton	2
7 What is an example of a mechanical barrier on leaves?	The waxy cuticle	2
8 What responses protect the lungs by mechanically ejecting pathogens from the respiratory system?	coughing and sneezing	4

10 The flushing action of what expels pathogens from the eyes?	tears	5
1 Chemical barriers also protect against infection.
2 The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the βdefensins.
3 Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva tears and breast milk are also antibacterials.
4 Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche when they become slightly acidic while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens.
5 In the stomach gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.

9 What compounds in the stomach protect against ingested pathogens?	gastric acid and proteases	5
10 Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical protective barrier following what?	menarche	4
1 Within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and in some cases by changing the conditions in their environment such as pH or available iron.
2 This reduces the probability that pathogens will reach sufficient numbers to cause illness.
3 However since most antibiotics nonspecifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi oral antibiotics can lead to an overgrowth of fungi and cause conditions such as a vaginal candidiasis a yeast infection.
4 There is good evidence that reintroduction of probiotic flora such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli normally found in unpasteurized yogurt helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on bacterial gastroenteritis inflammatory bowel diseases urinary tract infection and postsurgical infections.

1 Inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection.
2 The symptoms of inflammation are redness swelling heat and pain which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue.
3 Inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines which are released by injured or infected cells.
4 Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells leukocytes.
5 Common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells chemokines that promote chemotaxis and interferons that have antiviral effects such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell.
6 Growth factors and cytotoxic factors may also be released.
7 These cytokines and other chemicals recruit immune cells to the site of infection and promote healing of any damaged tissue following the removal of pathogens.
8 What is one of the first responses the immune system has to infection?	Inflammation	1
9 What causes the symptoms of inflammation?	increased blood flow into tissue	2
10 What compounds are released by injured or infected cells triggering inflammation?	eicosanoids and cytokines	3

12 What cytokines are responsible for communication between white blood cells?	interleukins	5
1 Phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called phagocytes that engulf or eat pathogens or particles.
2 Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens but can be called to specific locations by cytokines.
3 Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome.
4 The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome.
5 Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism.
6 Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.
7 What type of cells engulf or eat pathogens and foreign particles?	phagocytes	1
8 Phagocytes can be called to a specific location by what?	cytokines	2
9 When a pathogen has been eaten by a phagocyte it becomes trapped in what vesicle?	phagosome	3
10 What is formed when a phagosome fuses with a lysosome?	phagolysosome	4
11 Phagocytosis first evolved as means of doing what?	acquiring nutrients	5
1 Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens.
2 Neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte normally representing 50 to 60 of the total circulating leukocytes.
3 During the acute phase of inflammation particularly as a result of bacterial infection neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection.
4 Macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes complement proteins and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1.
5 Macrophages also act as scavengers ridding the body of wornout cells and other debris and as antigenpresenting cells that activate the adaptive immune system.
6 What are two types of phagocytes that travel through the body to find invading pathogens?	Neutrophils and macrophages	1

1 Leukocytes white blood cells act like independent singlecelled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system.
2 The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes macrophages neutrophils and dendritic cells mast cells eosinophils basophils and natural killer cells.
3 These cells identify and eliminate pathogens either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms.
4 Innate cells are also important mediators in the activation of the adaptive immune system.

6 What cells are the second arm of the innate immune system?	Leukocytes white blood cells	1
7 Innate cells can act as mediators in the activation of what branch of the immune system?	adaptive immune system	4
8 What are three kinds of phagocytes?	macrophages  neutrophils  and dendritic cells	2
1 Dendritic cells DC are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the external environment therefore they are located mainly in the skin nose lungs stomach and intestines.
2 They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites as both have many spinelike projections but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system.
3 Dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems as they present antigens to T cells one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.
4 What are the phagocytes that are located in tissues in contact with the external environment called?	Dendritic cells	1
5 Dendritic cells are named that because they resemble what?	neuronal dendrites	2
6 What are one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system?	T cells	3
7 Dendritic cells present antigens to what cells of the adaptive nervous system?	T cells	3
1 Natural killer cells or NK cells are a component of the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading microbes.
2 Rather NK cells destroy compromised host cells such as tumor cells or virusinfected cells recognizing such cells by a condition known as missing self.
3 This term describes cells with low levels of a cellsurface marker called MHC I major histocompatibility complex – a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells.
4 They were named natural killer because of the initial notion that they do not require activation in order to kill cells that are missing self.
5 For many years it was unclear how NK cells recognize tumor cells and infected cells.
6 It is now known that the MHC makeup on the surface of those cells is altered and the NK cells become activated through recognition of missing self.
7 Normal body cells are not recognized and attacked by NK cells because they express intact self MHC antigens.
8 Those MHC antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors KIR which essentially put the brakes on NK cells.
9 Natural killer cells recognize cells that should be targeted by a condition known as what?	missing self	2
10 What is one part of the innate immune system that doesnt attack microbes directly?	Natural killer cells	1
11 Missing self desribes cells that only have small amounts of what cellsurface marker?	MHC I major histocompatibility complex	3
12 MHC antigens on normal body cells are recognized by what receptor on NK cells?	killer cell immunoglobulin receptors KIR	8
1 The adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory where each pathogen is remembered by a signature antigen.
2 The adaptive immune response is antigenspecific and requires the recognition of specific nonself antigens during a process called antigen presentation.
3 Antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogeninfected cells.
4 The ability to mount these tailored responses is maintained in the body by memory cells.
5 Should a pathogen infect the body more than once these specific memory cells are used to quickly eliminate it.
6 In what types of organisms did the adaptive immune system first evolve?	vertebrates	1
7 The adaptive immune system recognizes nonself antigens during a process called what?	antigen presentation	2
8 Antigen specificity  allows responses that are specific to certain types of what?	pathogens or pathogeninfected cells	3
1 Both B cells and T cells carry receptor molecules that recognize specific targets.
2 T cells recognize a nonself target such as a pathogen only after antigens small fragments of the pathogen have been processed and presented in combination with a self receptor called a major histocompatibility complex MHC molecule.
3 There are two major subtypes of T cells the killer T cell and the helper T cell.
4 In addition there are regulatory T cells which have a role in modulating immune response.
5 Killer T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class I MHC molecules while helper T cells and regulatory T cells only recognize antigens coupled to Class II MHC molecules.
6 These two mechanisms of antigen presentation reflect the different roles of the two types of T cell.
7 A third minor subtype are the γδ T cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to MHC receptors.
8 What are the two major subtypes of T cells?	killer T cell and the helper T cell	3
9 What kind of T cells have the purpose of modulating the immune response?	regulatory T cells	4
10 Killer T cells can only recognize antigens coupled to what kind of molecules?	Class I MHC molecules	5
11 Helper and regulatory T cells can only recognize antigens coupled to what kind of molecules?	Class II MHC molecules	5
12 What class of T cells recognizes intact antigens that are not associated with MHC receptors?	γδ T cells	7
1 Killer T cells are a subgroup of T cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses and other pathogens or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional.
2 As with B cells each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen.
3 Killer T cells are activated when their T cell receptor TCR binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell.
4 Recognition of this MHCantigen complex is aided by a coreceptor on the T cell called CD8.
5 The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen.
6 When an activated T cell contacts such cells it releases cytotoxins such as perforin which form pores in the target cells plasma membrane allowing ions water and toxins to enter.
7 The entry of another toxin called granulysin a protease induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis.
8 T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses.
9 T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHCantigen activation signal or additional activation signals provided by helper T cells see below.
10 What kind of T cells kill cells that are infected with pathogens?	Killer T cells	1
11 What coreceptor on the T cell helps in recognizing the MHCantigen complex?	CD8	4
12 What is the receptor that killer T cells use to bind to specific antigens that are complexed with the MHC Class 1 receptor of another cell?	T cell receptor TCR	3
13 What toxin induces apoptosis in the target cell?	granulysin	7
14 When an activated killer T cell finds cells where the MHC 1 receptor has specific antigens it releases cytotoxins such as what?	perforin	6
1 Helper T cells express T cell receptors TCR that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules.
2 The MHCantigen complex is also recognized by the helper cells CD4 coreceptor which recruits molecules inside the T cell eg Lck that are responsible for the T cells activation.
3 Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHCantigen complex than observed for killer T cells meaning many receptors around 200–300 on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHCantigen in order to activate the helper cell while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHCantigen molecule.
4 Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigenpresenting cell.
5 The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types.
6 Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells.
7 In addition helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cells surface such as CD40 ligand also called CD154 which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibodyproducing B cells.
8 What coreceptor recruits molecules inside the T cell that are responsible for cell activation?	CD4 coreceptor	2
9 How many receptors on a helper T cell must be bound to a MHCantigen complex in order for the cell to be activated?	around 200–300	3
10 The receptors on a killer T cell must bind to how many MHC antigen complexes in order to activate the cell?	a single MHCantigen molecule	3
11 Activation of a helper T cell causes it to release what chemicals that influence cell activity?	cytokines	5
12 What is a ligand on the cell surface that is upregulated after helper T cell activation?	CD40 ligand	7
1 Gamma delta T cells γδ T cells possess an alternative T cell receptor TCR as opposed to CD4 and CD8 αβ T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells cytotoxic T cells and NK cells.
2 The conditions that produce responses from γδ T cells are not fully understood.
3 Like other unconventional T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs such as CD1drestricted Natural Killer T cells γδ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity.
4 On one hand γδ T cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype.
5 On the other hand the various subsets are also part of the innate immune system as restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors.

1 A B cell identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen.
2 This antigenantibody complex is taken up by the B cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides.
3 The B cell then displays these antigenic peptides on its surface MHC class II molecules.
4 This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell which releases lymphokines and activates the B cell.
5 As the activated B cell then begins to divide its offspring plasma cells secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen.
6 These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes.
7 Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.

1 When B cells and T cells are activated and begin to replicate some of their offspring become longlived memory cells.
2 Throughout the lifetime of an animal these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again.
3 This is adaptive because it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges.

1 Newborn infants have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection.
2 Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother.
3 During pregnancy a particular type of antibody called IgG is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother.
4 Breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies.
5 This is passive immunity because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies—it only borrows them.
6 This passive immunity is usually shortterm lasting from a few days up to several months.
7 In medicine protective passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibodyrich serum.

1 When suffering from sleep deprivation active immunizations may have a diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production and a lower immune response than would be noted in a wellrested individual.
2 Additionally proteins such as NFIL3 which have been shown to be closely intertwined with both Tcell differentiation and our circadian rhythms can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation shift work etc.

1 It is conjectured that a progressive decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals.
2 Conversely some hormones are regulated by the immune system notably thyroid hormone activity.
3 The agerelated decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels in the elderly.
4 As people age two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels.
5 First they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels.
6 This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation.
7 Second as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.

1 The main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer T cells sometimes with the assistance of helper T cells.
2 Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens.
3 This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal.
4 NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal this is a common phenomenon with tumors.
5 Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system.

1 Unlike animals plants lack phagocytic cells but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant.
2 Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogenassociated molecular patterns or PAMPs.
3 When a part of a plant becomes infected the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant.
4 Systemic acquired resistance SAR is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent.
5 RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication.

1 Longterm active memory is acquired following infection by activation of B and T cells.
2 Active immunity can also be generated artificially through vaccination.
3 The principle behind vaccination also called immunization is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism.
4 This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system as well as its inducibility.
5 With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.
6 By what process can active immunity be generated in an artificial manner?	vaccination	2
7 What is the process of vaccination also known as?	immunization	3
8 In the process of vaccination what is introduced in order to develop a specific immunity?	an antigen from a pathogen	3
9 Vaccination exploits what feature of the human immune system in order to be successful?	natural specificity of the immune system	4
1 The success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses.
2 Therefore pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host while evading detection or destruction by the immune system.
3 Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier for example by using a type II secretion system.
4 Alternatively using a type III secretion system they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host.
5 These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.

1 In the mid1950s Frank Burnet inspired by a suggestion made by Niels Jerne formulated the clonal selection theory CST of immunity.
2 On the basis of CST Burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the selfnonself distinction self constituents constituents of the body do not trigger destructive immune responses while nonself entities pathogens an allograft trigger a destructive immune response.
3 The theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex twosignal activation of T cells.
4 The selfnonself theory of immunity and the selfnonself vocabulary have been criticized but remain very influential.

8 What other scientist influence Frank Burnet when he was formulating his theory of immunity?	Niels Jerne	1
1 Antiinflammatory drugs are often used to control the effects of inflammation.
2 Glucocorticoids are the most powerful of these drugs however these drugs can have many undesirable side effects such as central obesity hyperglycemia osteoporosis and their use must be tightly controlled.
3 Lower doses of antiinflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.
4 Cytotoxic drugs inhibit the immune response by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells.
5 However the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected which causes toxic side effects.
6 Immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin prevent T cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways.
7 What are the most powerful class of antiinflammatory drugs?	Glucocorticoids	2
8 Low doses of antiinflammatories are sometimes used with what classes of drugs?	cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs	3
9 What are two examples of cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs?	methotrexate or azathioprine	3
10 What is an example of an immunosuppressive drug that prevents T cell activity by altering signal transduction pathways?	cyclosporin	6
1 In contrast during wake periods differentiated effector cells such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and CTLs cytotoxic T lymphocytes peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens.
2 As well during awake active times antiinflammatory molecules such as cortisol and catecholamines peak.
3 There are two theories as to why the proinflammatory state is reserved for sleep time.
4 First inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times.
5 Second inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin.
6 Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.

10 Melatonin during sleep can actively counteract the production of what?	free radical production	6
1 When a Tcell encounters a foreign pathogen it extends a vitamin D receptor.
2 This is essentially a signaling device that allows the Tcell to bind to the active form of vitamin D the steroid hormone calcitriol.
3 Tcells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin D Not only does the Tcell extend a vitamin D receptor in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin D calcitriol but the Tcell expresses the gene CYP27B1 which is the gene responsible for converting the prehormone version of vitamin D calcidiol into the steroid hormone version calcitriol.
4 Only after binding to calcitriol can Tcells perform their intended function.
5 Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate vitamin D calcidiol are dendritic cells keratinocytes and macrophages.
6 What does a T cell extend when it encounters a foreign pathogen?	a vitamin D receptor	1
7 What is the active form of vitamin D known as?	calcitriol	2

1 Evolution of the adaptive immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates.
2 Many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system eg immunoglobulins and T cell receptors exist only in jawed vertebrates.
3 However a distinct lymphocytederived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates such as the lamprey and hagfish.
4 These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors VLRs that like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates are produced from only a small number one or two of genes.

1 It is likely that a multicomponent adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibodybased humoral response.
2 Many species however utilize mechanisms that appear to be precursors of these aspects of vertebrate immunity.
3 Immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens called bacteriophages.
4 Prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity through a system that uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past which allows them to block virus replication through a form of RNA interference.
5 Offensive elements of the immune systems are also present in unicellular eukaryotes but studies of their roles in defense are few.

1 Immunology is strongly experimental in everyday practice but is also characterized by an ongoing theoretical attitude.
2 Many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time.
3 The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between cellular and humoral theories of immunity.
4 According to the cellular theory of immunity represented in particular by Elie Metchnikoff it was cells – more precisely phagocytes – that were responsible for immune responses.
5 In contrast the humoral theory of immunity held among others by Robert Koch and Emil von Behring stated that the active immune agents were soluble components molecules found in the organism’s “humors” rather than its cells.

10 According to the humoral theory of immunity what were the bodies immune agents?	soluble components molecules	5
1 Clearly some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers.
2 Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I molecules on their surface thus avoiding detection by killer T cells.
3 Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response for example by secreting the cytokine TGFβ which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes.
4 In addition immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens so the immune system no longer attacks the tumor cells.
5 Tumors that are able to evade the bodys immune response can become what?	cancers	1
6 What receptors do tumor cells often have reduced concentrations of?	MHC class I molecules	2
7 What is a chemical secreted by tumors that suppresses the immune response?	cytokine TGFβ	3
8 Cytokine TBFB suppresses the activity of what cell types?	macrophages and lymphocytes	3
1 Hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the bodys own tissues.
2 They are divided into four classes Type I – IV based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction.
3 Type I hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction often associated with allergy.
4 Symptoms can range from mild discomfort to death.
5 Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when crosslinked by antigen.
6 Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patients own cells marking them for destruction.
7 This is also called antibodydependent or cytotoxic hypersensitivity and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies.
8 Immune complexes aggregations of antigens complement proteins and IgG and IgM antibodies deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions.
9 Type IV hypersensitivity also known as cellmediated or delayed type hypersensitivity usually takes between two and three days to develop.
10 Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases but may also involve contact dermatitis poison ivy.
11 These reactions are mediated by T cells monocytes and macrophages.
12 What is the name for a response of the immune system that damages the bodys native tissues?	Hypersensitivity	1
13 How many classes of immune hypersensitivity are there?	four classes Type I – IV	2

16 Antibodydependent hypersensitivity belongs to what class of hypersensitivity?	Type II hypersensitivity	6
1 An evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host also called intracellular pathogenesis.
2 Here a pathogen spends most of its lifecycle inside host cells where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells antibodies and complement.
3 Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria Plasmodium falciparum and leishmaniasis Leishmania spp.
4 Other bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement.
5 Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the hosts immune response.
6 Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system.
7 Such biofilms are present in many successful infections eg the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis.
8 Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies rendering them ineffective examples include Streptococcus protein G Staphylococcus aureus protein A and Peptostreptococcus magnus protein L.
9 What is the process by which pathogens evade the immune system by hiding inside the host cells called?	intracellular pathogenesis	1
10 What food bacteria is an example of intracellular pathogenesis?	Salmonella	3

12 What bacteria lives inside a protective capsule that serves to prevent cell lysis?	Mycobacterium tuberculosis	4
13 What protein does Staphylococcus aureus produce to make antibodies ineffective?	protein A	8
1 The mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated.
2 The simplest approach is to rapidly change nonessential epitopes amino acids andor sugars on the surface of the pathogen while keeping essential epitopes concealed.
3 This is called antigenic variation.
4 An example is HIV which mutates rapidly so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing.
5 These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus.
6 The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy constantly switching one type of surface protein for another allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response.
7 Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system.
8 In HIV the envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell such selfcloaked viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as nonself structures.
9 What is the process by which the adaptive immune system is evaded by the chainging of nonessential epitopes called?	antigenic variation	3
10 What is an example of a virus that uses antigenic variation?	HIV	4
11 What is an example of a parasite that used the antigenic variation strategy to evade destruction?	Trypanosoma brucei	6
12 What compounds can be masked with the molecules of the host cell in order for a virus to evade detection?	antigens	7
1 Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate tumors.
2 This is called immune surveillance.
3 The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells.
4 To the immune system these antigens appear foreign and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells.
5 The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus which causes cervical cancer while others are the organisms own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells.
6 One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that when expressed at high levels transforms certain skin cells eg.
7 melanocytes into tumors called melanomas.
8 A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.

12 What are cancerous tumors of the skin known as?	melanomas	7
13 What are the skin cells that can be transformed into tumors known as?	melanocytes	7
1 Larger drugs 500 Da can provoke a neutralizing immune response particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly or in larger doses.
2 This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins which are typically larger than 6000 Da.
3 In some cases the drug itself is not immunogenic but may be coadministered with an immunogenic compound as is sometimes the case for Taxol.
4 Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles and validation of proposed peptidebased drug treatments.
5 Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids however more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes usually on wellstudied virus proteins as a training set.
6 A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells.
7 The emerging field of bioinformaticsbased studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics.

13 What is the field of studying immunogenicity through bioinformatics known as?	immunoinformatics	7
1 In addition to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity.
2 First during the early slowwavesleep stage a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol epinephrine and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin pituitary growth hormone and prolactin.
3 These signals induce a proinflammatory state through the production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin1 interleukin12 TNFalpha and IFNgamma.
4 These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation proliferation and differentiation.
5 It is during this time that undifferentiated or less differentiated like naïve and central memory T cells peak ie.
6 during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response.
7 In addition to these effects the milieu of hormones produced at this time leptin pituitary growth hormone and prolactin support the interactions between APCs and Tcells a shift of the Th1Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1 an increase in overall Th cell proliferation and naïve T cell migration to lymph nodes.
8 This milieu is also thought to support the formation of longlasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.

12 Sleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response?	Th1 immune responses	8
1 In humans this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes.
2 This recognition signal triggers a rapid killing response.
3 The speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules which are also proteases.
4 After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe they activate their protease activity which in turn activates other complement proteases and so on.
5 This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback.
6 The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells increase vascular permeability and opsonize coat the surface of a pathogen marking it for destruction.
7 This deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.
8 Complement proteins bind to what kind of molecules on the surface of microbes in order to elicit an immune response?	carbohydrates	1

1 Following the Peterloo massacre of 1819 poet Percy Shelley wrote the political poem The Mask of Anarchy later that year that begins with the images of what he thought to be the unjust forms of authority of his time—and then imagines the stirrings of a new form of social action.
2 It is perhaps the first modernvague statement of the principle of nonviolent protest.
3 A version was taken up by the author Henry David Thoreau in his essay Civil Disobedience and later by Gandhi in his doctrine of Satyagraha.
4 Gandhis Satyagraha was partially influenced and inspired by Shelleys nonviolence in protest and political action.

1 LeGrande writes that the formulation of a single allencompassing definition of the term is extremely difficult if not impossible.
2 In reviewing the voluminous literature on the subject the student of civil disobedience rapidly finds himself surrounded by a maze of semantical problems and grammatical niceties.
3 Like Alice in Wonderland he often finds that specific terminology has no more or no less meaning than the individual orator intends it to have.
4 He encourages a distinction between lawful protest demonstration nonviolent civil disobedience and violent civil disobedience.

1 Civil disobedience is usually defined as pertaining to a citizens relation to the state and its laws as distinguished from a constitutional impasse in which two public agencies especially two equally sovereign branches of government conflict.
2 For instance if the head of government of a country were to refuse to enforce a decision of that countrys highest court it would not be civil disobedience since the head of government would be acting in her or his capacity as public official rather than private citizen.
3 If the head of government refuses to enforce a decision of the highest court what terminology could be used?	constitutional impasse	1
4 Constitutional impasse is different from civil disobedience because does not include what type of person?	citizens	1

11 Civil Disobedience is mainly performed by what population group?	private citizen	2
12 What group of people cannot be part of civil disobedience?	sovereign branches of government	1
1 However this definition is disputed by Thoreaus political philosophy pitching the conscience vs the collective.
2 The individual is the final judge of right and wrong.
3 More than this since only individuals act only individuals can act unjustly.
4 When the government knocks on the door it is an individual in the form of a postman or tax collector whose hand hits the wood.
5 Before Thoreau’s imprisonment when a confused taxman had wondered aloud about how to handle his refusal to pay Thoreau had advised “Resign” If a man chose to be an agent of injustice then Thoreau insisted on confronting him with the fact that he was making a choice.
6 But if government is “the voice of the people” as it is often called shouldn’t that voice be heeded.
7 Thoreau admits that government may express the will of the majority but it may also express nothing more than the will of elite politicians.
8 Even a good form of government is “liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it” Moreover even if a government did express the voice of the people this fact would not compel the obedience of individuals who disagree with what is being said.
9 The majority may be powerful but it is not necessarily right.
10 What then is the proper relationship between the individual and the government.
11 What author argues pitching the conscience versus the collective?	Thoreau	1

1 Some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities.
2 Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of nongovernmental agencies such as trade unions banks and private universities can be justified if it reflects a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken.
3 The same principle she argues applies to breaches of law in protest against international organizations and foreign governments.

1 It is usually recognized that lawbreaking if it is not done publicly at least must be publicly announced in order to constitute civil disobedience.
2 But Stephen Eilmann argues that if it is necessary to disobey rules that conflict with morality we might ask why disobedience should take the form of public civil disobedience rather than simply covert lawbreaking.
3 If a lawyer wishes to help a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights he might for instance find that assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than open disobedience.
4 This assumes that common morality does not have a prohibition on deceit in such situations.
5 The Fully Informed Jury Associations publication A Primer for Prospective Jurors notes Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitlers secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house.
6 By this definition civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it.

1 There have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be nonviolent.
2 Blacks Law Dictionary includes nonviolence in its definition of civil disobedience.
3 Christian Bays encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires carefully chosen and legitimate means but holds that they do not have to be nonviolent.
4 It has been argued that while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects rebellion is much more destructive therefore the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience and if one cannot justify civil rebellion then one cannot justify a civil disobedients use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest.

1 Civil disobedients have chosen a variety of different illegal acts.
2 Bedau writes There is a whole class of acts undertaken in the name of civil disobedience which even if they were widely practiced would in themselves constitute hardly more than a nuisance eg.
3 trespassing at a nuclearmissile installationSuch acts are often just a harassment and at least to the bystander somewhat inaneThe remoteness of the connection between the disobedient act and the objectionable law lays such acts open to the charge of ineffectiveness and absurdity.
4 Bedau also notes though that the very harmlessness of such entirely symbolic illegal protests toward public policy goals may serve a propaganda purpose.
5 Some civil disobedients such as the proprietors of illegal medical cannabis dispensaries and Voice in the Wilderness which brought medicine to Iraq without the permission of the US Government directly achieve a desired social goal such as the provision of medication to the sick while openly breaking the law.
6 Julia Butterfly Hill lived in Luna a 180foot 55 mtall 600yearold California Redwood tree for 738 days successfully preventing it from being cut down.

1 In cases where the criminalized behavior is pure speech civil disobedience can consist simply of engaging in the forbidden speech.
2 An example would be WBAIs broadcasting the track Filthy Words from a George Carlin comedy album which eventually led to the 1978 Supreme Court case of FCC v Pacifica Foundation.
3 Threatening government officials is another classic way of expressing defiance toward the government and unwillingness to stand for its policies.

1 Some forms of civil disobedience such as illegal boycotts refusals to pay taxes draft dodging distributed denialofservice attacks and sitins make it more difficult for a system to function.
2 In this way they might be considered coercive.
3 Brownlee notes that although civil disobedients are constrained in their use of coercion by their conscientious aim to engage in moral dialogue nevertheless they may find it necessary to employ limited coercion in order to get their issue onto the table.
4 The Plowshares organization temporarily closed GCSB Waihopai by padlocking the gates and using sickles to deflate one of the large domes covering two satellite dishes.
5 Boycotting refusing to pay taxes sit ins and draft dodging all make what harder?	system to function	1

1 Many of the same decisions and principles that apply in other criminal investigations and arrests arise also in civil disobedience cases.
2 For example the suspect may need to decide whether or not to grant a consent search of his property and whether or not to talk to police officers.
3 It is generally agreed within the legal community and is often believed within the activist community that a suspects talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose and may be harmful.
4 However some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators questions sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications or due to a fear of seeming rude.
5 Also some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers.
6 Thoreau wrote My civil neighbor the taxgatherer is the very man I have to deal withfor it is after all with men and not with parchment that I quarreland he has voluntarily chosen to be an agent of the government.
7 How shall he ever know well that he is and does as an officer of the government or as a man until he is obliged to consider whether he will treat me his neighbor for whom he has respect as a neighbor and welldisposed man or as a maniac and disturber of the peace and see if he can get over this obstruction to his neighborliness without a ruder and more impetuous thought or speech corresponding with his action.
8 What type of government investigations apply to civil disobedience?	criminal investigations	1

1 Some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established or else suffer the penalties set out in the law.
2 Other civil disobedients who favor the existence of government still dont believe in the legitimacy of their particular government or dont believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted.
3 And still other civil disobedients being anarchists dont believe in the legitimacy of any government and therefore see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others.
4 What do some civil disobedient people feel the need to acknowledge	accept punishment 	1.
5 Why is the need for acceptance of punishment needed?	validity of the social contract	1

8 Anarchists do not want to accept punishment for what reason?	does not infringe the rights of others	3
1 An important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty.
2 There is much debate on this point as some believe that it is a civil disobedients duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law.
3 It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience.
4 ACTUPs Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating Yes I committed the act of which you accuse me.
5 I dont deny it in fact I am proud of it.
6 I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law I am guilty as charged but that pleading not guilty sends a message of Guilt implies wrongdoing.
7 I feel I have done no wrong.
8 I may have violated some specific laws but I am guilty of doing no wrong.
9 I therefore plead not guilty.
10 A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two.
11 One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power when asked to enter his plea stated I plead for the beauty that surrounds us this is known as a creative plea and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty.

1 When the Committee for NonViolent Action sponsored a protest in August 1957 at the Camp Mercury nuclear test site near Las Vegas Nevada 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest.
2 At a prearranged announced time one at a time they stepped across the line and were immediately arrested.
3 They were put on a bus and taken to the Nye County seat of Tonopah Nevada and arraigned for trial before the local Justice of the Peace that afternoon.
4 A well known civil rights attorney Francis Heisler had volunteered to defend the arrested persons advising them to plead nolo contendere as an alternative to pleading either guilty or notguilty.
5 The arrested persons were found guilty nevertheless and given suspended sentences conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds.

1 Howard Zinn writes There may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail as a way of continuing their protest as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice.
2 But that is different than the notion that they must go to jail as part of a rule connected with civil disobedience.
3 The key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way whether it is done by remaining in jail or by evading it.
4 To accept jail penitently as an accession to the rules is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience to demean the seriousness of the protestIn particular the neoconservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated.
5 Why do some people chose to go to jail for their disobedience?	a way of continuing their protest	1
6 Going to jail accomplished what goal of civil disobedience?	reminding their countrymen of injustice	1
7 What is the most important item for civil disobedience to follow through?	protest should be maintained all the way	3
8 Why should one not go to jail?	accept jail penitently	4
1 Sometimes the prosecution proposes a plea bargain to civil disobedients as in the case of the Camden 28 in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanor count and receive no jail time.
2 In some mass arrest situations the activists decide to use solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone.
3 But some activists have opted to enter a blind plea pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place.
4 Mohandas Gandhi pleaded guilty and told the court I am here to .
5 .
6 .
7 submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen.
8 What type of punishment is sometimes offered to civil disobedients?	plea bargain	1
9 What is usually the goal of taking a plea bargain?	no jail time	1

11 What type of plea is sometimes taken as an act of disobedience?	blind plea	3
12 Which famous Indian took a plea and put himself at the mercy of the courts?	Mohandas Gandhi	4
1 Some civil disobedience defendants choose to make a defiant speech or a speech explaining their actions in allocution.
2 In US v BurgosAndujar a defendant who was involved in a movement to stop military exercises by trespassing on US Navy property argued to the court in allocution that the ones who are violating the greater law are the members of the Navy.
3 As a result the judge increased her sentence from 40 to 60 days.
4 This action was upheld because according to the US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit her statement suggested a lack of remorse an attempt to avoid responsibility for her actions and even a likelihood of repeating her illegal actions.
5 Some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials.
6 What way do some people perform civil disobedience in a constructive way?	defiant speech	1
7 Why would one want to give a speech?	explaining their actions	1
8 Why is giving a defiant speech sometimes more harmful for the individual?	lack of remorse	4
9 Why would one want to give more punishment?	likelihood of repeating	4
10 What type of treatment do civil disobedients usually receive?	mistreatment from government officials	5
1 Steven Barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience.
2 A technical defense may enhance the chances for acquittal but make for more boring proceedings and reduced press coverage.
3 During the Vietnam War era the Chicago Eight used a political defense while Benjamin Spock used a technical defense.
4 In countries such as the United States whose laws guarantee the right to a jury trial but do not excuse lawbreaking for political purposes some civil disobedients seek jury nullification.
5 Over the years this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as Sparf v United States which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative and United States v Dougherty which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification.
6 What is the primary goal of pleading not guilty when arrested for Civil Disobedience?	acquittal and avoid imprisonment	1

1 One theory is that while disobedience may be helpful any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit.
2 Therefore conscientious lawbreakers must be punished.
3 Michael Bayles argues that if a person violates a law in order to create a test case as to the constitutionality of a law and then wins his case then that act did not constitute civil disobedience.
4 It has also been argued that breaking the law for selfgratification as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law is not civil disobedience.
5 Likewise a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution or by denying having committed the crime or by fleeing the jurisdiction is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient.
6 What needs to be avoided with civil disobedience?	general disobedience	1
7 Why should disobedience by the general public be avoided?	neither conscientious nor of social benefit	1
8 What is one main reason that civil disobedience is not recognized?	breaking the law for selfgratification	4
9 Why should someone not commit a crime when they are protesting?	not being a civil disobedient	5
10 For what reason would someone avoid crimes while protesting?	avoiding attribution	5
1 Courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience Indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not itself the object of protest whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law.
2 During the Vietnam War courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the Vietnam War the courts ruled it was a political question.
3 The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom.
4 However court cases such as US v Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense.
5 Likewise when Carter Wentworth was charged for his role in the Clamshell Alliances 1977 illegal occupation of the Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense and he was found guilty.
6 Fully Informed Jury Association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to according to FIJA many of them have escaped prosecution because prosecutors have reasoned correctly that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleters own jury as evidence.
7 What is violating a law which is not the goal of the protest called?	Indirect civil disobedience	1
8 When the law is a direct target of the protest what is this called?	direct civil disobedience	1
9 What US war caused a high amount of civil disobedience?	Vietnam War	2
10 What type of defense is sometimes used in court by protestors?	competing harms defense	5
11 Why are people who distribute leaflets inside courthouses not been arrested?	the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleters own jury as evidence	6
1 Along with giving the offender his just deserts achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment.
2 Brownlee argues Bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law’s engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law.
3 Leonard Hubert Hoffmann writes In deciding whether or not to impose punishment the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good.
4 This means that the objector has no right not to be punished.
5 It is a matter for the state including the judges to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not.
6 What is the main goal of criminal punishment of civil disobedients?	incapacitation	1
7 What should be the main goal of not using punishment in a just system?	would do more harm than good	3
8 Who decides the fate of protesters most of the time?	the state	5
9 What should the punishment rely on instead in a just society?	moral reasons to follow this law	2
1 Construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure.
2 Construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser while construction typically takes place on location for a known client.
3 Construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries.
4 Construction starts with planningcitation needed design and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use.

1 Building construction is the process of adding structure to real property or construction of buildings.
2 The majority of building construction jobs are small renovations such as addition of a room or renovation of a bathroom.
3 Often the owner of the property acts as laborer paymaster and design team for the entire project.
4 Although building construction projects typically include various common elements such as design financial estimating and legal considerations many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results such as structural collapse cost overruns andor litigation.
5 For this reason those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome.

1 In the modern industrialized world construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality.
2 A formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts.
3 The design usually consists of drawings and specifications usually prepared by a design team including Architect civil engineers mechanical engineers electrical engineers structural engineers fire protection engineers planning consultants architectural consultants and archaeological consultants.
4 The design team is most commonly employed by ie.
5 in contract with the property owner.
6 Under this system once the design is completed by the design team a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work either based directly on the design or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor.
7 Following evaluation of bids the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder.

1 The modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties especially among large firms.
2 In the past architects interior designers engineers developers construction managers and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies even in the larger firms.
3 Presently a firm that is nominally an architecture or construction management firm may have experts from all related fields as employees or to have an associated company that provides each necessary skill.
4 Thus each such firm may offer itself as onestop shopping for a construction project from beginning to end.
5 This is designated as a design build contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction while adhering to the performance specifications.

1 Several project structures can assist the owner in this integration including designbuild partnering and construction management.
2 In general each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects interior designers engineers and constructors throughout design and construction.
3 In response many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the designbuild process.

1 Construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems.
2 Underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project.
3 Cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and materials and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time can arise even when the overall total is enough.
4 Fraud is a problem in many fields but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field.
5 Financial planning for the project is intended to ensure that a solid plan with adequate safeguards and contingency plans are in place before the project is started and is required to ensure that the plan is properly executed over the life of the project.
6 What can construction projects suffer from?	preventable financial problems	1
7 What is an underbid?	when builders ask for too little money to complete the project	2
8 When do cash flow problems exist?	when the present amount of funding cannot cover the current costs for labour and materials	3
9 What financial issue is notoriously prevalent in the construction field?	Fraud	4
1 Mortgage bankers accountants and cost engineers are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project.
2 The presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely even in relatively small projects since the owners equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project.
3 Accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process.
4 Cost engineers and estimators apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation.
5 Cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid.

1 The project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements.
2 Constructing a project that fails to adhere to codes does not benefit the owner.
3 Some legal requirements come from malum in se considerations or the desire to prevent things that are indisputably bad – bridge collapses or explosions.
4 Other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations or things that are a matter of custom or expectation such as isolating businesses to a business district and residences to a residential district.
5 An attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable the bridge design will not cause a collapse or that the custom is no longer needed acceptance of livework spaces has grown in the community.

1 A construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations each of which all parties must carefully consider.
2 A contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible.
3 The time element in construction means that a delay costs money and in cases of bottlenecks the delay can be extremely expensive.
4 Thus the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out.
5 Contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse.

1 There is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a cooperative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project.
2 New forms include partnering such as PublicPrivate Partnering PPPs aka private finance initiatives PFIs and alliances such as pure or project alliances and impure or strategic alliances.
3 The focus on cooperation is to ameliorate the many problems that arise from the often highly competitive and adversarial practices within the construction industry.

2 In this arrangement the architect or engineer acts as the project coordinator.
3 His or her role is to design the works prepare the specifications and produce construction drawings administer the contract tender the works and manage the works from inception to completion.
4 There are direct contractual links between the architects client and the main contractor.
5 Any subcontractor has a direct contractual relationship with the main contractor.
6 The procedure continues until the building is ready to occupy.

1 The owner produces a list of requirements for a project giving an overall view of the projects goals.
2 Several DB contractors present different ideas about how to accomplish these goals.
3 The owner selects the ideas he or she likes best and hires the appropriate contractor.
4 Often it is not just one contractor but a consortium of several contractors working together.
5 Once these have been hired they begin building the first phase of the project.
6 As they build phase 1 they design phase 2.
7 This is in contrast to a designbidbuild contract where the project is completely designed by the owner then bid on then completed.

1 Before the foundation can be dug contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services.
2 This lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical water sewage phone and cable facilities which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations.
3 During the construction of a building the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code.
4 Once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed an occupancy permit may be issued.

1 Construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the United States and in the European Union.
2 In 2009 the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for all workers.
3 Falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and nonfatal injuries among construction workers.
4 Proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry.

1 Religiously affiliated and denominational schools form a subcategory of private schools.
2 Some such schools teach religious education together with the usual academic subjects to impress their particular faiths beliefs and traditions in the students who attend.
3 Others use the denomination as more of a general label to describe on what the founders based their belief while still maintaining a fine distinction between academics and religion.

1 The right to create private schools in Germany is in Article 7 Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz and cannot be suspended even in a state of emergency.
2 It is also not possible to abolish these rights.
3 This unusual protection of private schools was implemented to protect these schools from a second Gleichschaltung or similar event in the future.
4 Still they are less common than in many other countries.
5 Overall between 1992 and 2008 the percent of pupils in such schools in Germany increased from 61 to 78 including rise from 05 to 61 in the former GDR.
6 Percent of students in private high schools reached 111.

1 In 1846 the natural history lectures of Louis Agassiz were acclaimed both in New York and on the campus at Harvard College.
2 Agassizs approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans participation in the Divine Nature and the possibility of understanding intellectual existences.
3 Agassizs perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the divine plan in all phenomena.
4 When it came to explaining lifeforms Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence.
5 This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time.
6 The popularity of Agassizs efforts to soar with Plato probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth John Norrisand in a Romantic vein Samuel Coleridge.

5 According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report the wealthiest 1 owns 46 of the worlds wealth the 85 richest people a small part of the wealthiest 1 own about 07 of the human populations wealth which is the same as the bottom half of the population.
6 More recently in January 2015 Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016.
7 An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1 now own nearly half of the worlds wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession.
8 In October 2015 Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase and that half of the worlds wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile whose assets each exceed 759900.
9 A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined.
10 Oxfams claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used by using net wealth adding up assets and subtracting debts the Oxfam report for instance finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China due to a greater tendency to take on debts.

1 Neoclassical economics views inequalities in the distribution of income as arising from differences in value added by labor capital and land.
2 Within labor income distribution is due to differences in value added by different classifications of workers.
3 In this perspective wages and profits are determined by the marginal value added of each economic actor worker capitalistbusiness owner landlord.
4 Thus in a market economy inequality is a reflection of the productivity gap between highlypaid professions and lowerpaid professions.

1 In Marxian analysis capitalist firms increasingly substitute capital equipment for labor inputs workers under competitive pressure to reduce costs and maximize profits.
2 Over the longterm this trend increases the organic composition of capital meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs increasing unemployment the reserve army of labour.
3 This process exerts a downward pressure on wages.
4 The substitution of capital equipment for labor mechanization and automation raises the productivity of each worker resulting in a situation of relatively stagnant wages for the working class amidst rising levels of property income for the capitalist class.
5 What pushes businesses to increase pressures on workers?	reduce costs and maximize profits	1
6 What impact does workers working harder have on productivity of a business?	less workers are required	2

12 What does the substitution of equipment for labor raise for workers?	productivity	4
13 What type of wages does mechanization and automation lead to?	stagnant	4
1 In a purely capitalist mode of production ie.
2 where professional and labor organizations cannot limit the number of workers the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations or by the employer but rather by the market.
3 Wages work in the same way as prices for any other good.
4 Thus wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill.
5 And therefore inequality is driven by this price.
6 Under the law of supply and demand the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker.
7 On the other hand markets can also concentrate wealth pass environmental costs on to society and abuse workers and consumers.
8 Markets by themselves even when they are stable often lead to high levels of inequality outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair.
9 Employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed.
10 Their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor.
11 For a businessman who has the profit motive as the prime interest it is a losing proposition to offer below or above market wages to workers.

18 What do wages work in the same way as for any other good?	prices	3
19 What can be considered as a function of market price of skill?	wages	4
20 What can concentrate wealth pass environmental costs on to society and abuse both workers and consumers?	markets	7
21 What type of outcomes can even stable markets lead to?	unfair	8
1 A job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time high supply competing for a job that few require low demand will result in a low wage for that job.
2 This is because competition between workers drives down the wage.
3 An example of this would be jobs such as dishwashing or customer service.
4 Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job.
5 A job where there are few able or willing workers low supply but a large need for the positions high demand will result in high wages for that job.
6 This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage.
7 Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills rare abilities or a high level of risk.
8 Competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position.
9 Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members.
10 Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining political influence or corruption.
11 What has the tendency to increase wages in a field or job position?	Competition amongst workers	4
12 When there are many workers competing for a few jobs its considered as what?	low demand	1
13 What is the potential earnings for a job where there are few skilled workers but many available positions?	high wages	5

18 Why does competition among workers drive down wages?	expendable nature of the worker	4
19 What type of wages result from jobs where there is low supply but high demand?	high	5
20 While competition between workers drives down wages for jobs with a high supply of worker whose competition drives wages up for the inverse?	employers	8
1 On the other hand higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level selfemployment.
2 However most of it is often based on necessity rather than opportunity.
3 Necessitybased entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs such as income for food and shelter push motivations whereas opportunitybased entrepreneurship is driven by achievementoriented motivations pull such as vocation and more likely to involve the pursue of new products services or underserved market needs.
4 The economic impact of the former type of entrepreneurialism tends to be redistributive while the latter is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth.
5 What increases with the increase of income inequality?	entrepreneurship rates	1
6 Survivial is at the heart of what concept for workers?	Necessitybased entrepreneurship	3

13 What motivation is opportunitybased entrepreneurship driven by?	achievementoriented	3
14 What type of impact does opportunitybased entrepreneurship tend to have on economic growth?	positive	4
1 Another cause is the rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system.
2 A progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases.
3 In a progressive tax system the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society either increasing it or decreasing it provided that income does not change as a result of the change in tax regime.
4 Additionally steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board.
5 The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.
6 What is it called when the tax rate and base amount increase simultaneously?	progressive tax	2
7 What tax rate has a direct relationship with income inequality?	top tax rate	3
8 What can work to even the distribution of wealth?	social spending	4
9 What system has an impact on income inequality?	tax system	1
10 In a progressive tax what increases as the taxable base amount increases?	the tax rate	2
11 What will have a direct impact of inequality in a system that uses a progressive tax?	level of the top tax rate	3
12 What can result in more equal distribution of income?	steeper tax	4
13 What index is an indicator of the effects of taxes applied to social spending?	the Gini index	5
1 An important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals access to education.
2 Education especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers creates high wages for those with this education however increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality.
3 As a result those who are unable to afford an education or choose not to pursue optional education generally receive much lower wages.
4 The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes and thus lower aggregate savings and investment.
5 Conversely education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor.

1 In 2014 economists with the Standard  Poors rating agency concluded that the widening disparity between the USs wealthiest citizens and the rest of the nation had slowed its recovery from the 20082009 recession and made it more prone to boomandbust cycles.
2 To partially remedy the wealth gap and the resulting slow growth SP recommended increasing access to education.

1 During the mass high school education movement from 1910–1940 there was an increase in skilled workers which led to a decrease in the price of skilled labor.
2 High school education during the period was designed to equip students with necessary skill sets to be able to perform at work.
3 In fact it differs from the present high school education which is regarded as a steppingstone to acquire college and advanced degrees.
4 This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers.
5 Education is very important for the growth of the economy however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy.
6 Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth and continued gender inequality in education thus creating a poverty trap.
7 It is suggested that a large gap in male and female education may indicate backwardness and so may be associated with lower economic growth which can explain why there is economic inequality between countries.

1 John Schmitt and Ben Zipperer 2006 of the CEPR point to economic liberalism and the reduction of business regulation along with the decline of union membership as one of the causes of economic inequality.
2 In an analysis of the effects of intensive AngloAmerican liberal policies in comparison to continental European liberalism where unions have remained strong they concluded The US economic and social model is associated with substantial levels of social exclusion including high levels of income inequality high relative and absolute poverty rates poor and unequal educational outcomes poor health outcomes and high rates of crime and incarceration.
3 At the same time the available evidence provides little support for the view that USstyle labormarket flexibility dramatically improves labormarket outcomes.
4 Despite popular prejudices to the contrary the US economy consistently affords a lower level of economic mobility than all the continental European countries for which data is available.

1 Sociologist Jake Rosenfield of the University of Washington asserts that the decline of organized labor in the United States has played a more significant role in expanding the income gap than technological changes and globalization which were also experienced by other industrialized nations that didnt experience steep surges in inequality.
2 He points out that nations with high rates of unionization particularly in Scandinavia have very low levels of inequality and concludes the historical pattern is clear the crossnational pattern is clear high inequality goes handinhand with weak labor movements and viceversa.

1 Trade liberalization may shift economic inequality from a global to a domestic scale.
2 When rich countries trade with poor countries the lowskilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition while lowskilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages.
3 Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States.
4 He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable.
5 However he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes such as technological innovation a view shared by other experts.
6 Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus CrespoCuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality.
7 They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes.
8 Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 515 of rising income inequality.
9 Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that lowskilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of lowskilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.
10 What effect does trade with poorer countries have on the workers in richer countries?	reduced wages	2
11 What effect does trade with richer countries have on the workers in poorer countries?	increased wages	2
12 What has a bigger impact on the United States economy more than trade?	technological innovation	5

1 In many countries there is a Gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market.
2 Several factors other than discrimination may contribute to this gap.
3 On average women are more likely than men to consider factors other than pay when looking for work and may be less willing to travel or relocate.
4 Thomas Sowell in his book Knowledge and Decisions claims that this difference is due to women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy but income studies show that that does not explain the entire difference.
5 A US Censuss report stated that in US once other factors are accounted for there is still a difference in earnings between women and men.
6 The income gap in other countries ranges from 53 in Botswana to 40 in Bahrain.

1 Economist Simon Kuznets argued that levels of economic inequality are in large part the result of stages of development.
2 According to Kuznets countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth.
3 As a country develops it acquires more capital which leads to the owners of this capital having more wealth and income and introducing inequality.
4 Eventually through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality.

1 Plotting the relationship between level of income and inequality Kuznets saw middleincome developing economies level of inequality bulging out to form what is now known as the Kuznets curve.
2 Kuznets demonstrated this relationship using crosssectional data.
3 However more recent testing of this theory with superior panel data has shown it to be very weak.
4 Kuznets curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time.
5 As an example income inequality did fall in the United States during its High school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter.
6 citation needed However recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s.
7 This does not necessarily disprove Kuznets theory.
8 citation needed It may be possible that another Kuznets cycle is occurring specifically the move from the manufacturing sector to the service sector.
9 citation needed This implies that it may be possible for multiple Kuznets cycles to be in effect at any given time.

1 Wealth concentration is a theoreticalaccording to whom.
2 process by which under certain conditions newly created wealth concentrates in the possession of alreadywealthy individuals or entities.
3 According to this theory those who already hold wealth have the means to invest in new sources of creating wealth or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth thus are the beneficiaries of the new wealth.
4 Over time wealth condensation can significantly contribute to the persistence of inequality within society.
5 Thomas Piketty in his book Capital in the TwentyFirst Century argues that the fundamental force for divergence is the usually greater return of capital r than economic growth g and that larger fortunes generate higher returns pp.

1 Economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration which may better be explained by the nonmarket force known as rentseeking.
2 While the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation greater productivity etc it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices profits and large compensation.
3 A better explainer of growing inequality according to Stiglitz is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them.
4 This process known to economists as rentseeking brings income not from creation of wealth but from grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort.

1 2013 Economics Nobel prize winner Robert J Shiller said that rising inequality in the United States and elsewhere is the most important problem.
2 Increasing inequality harms economic growth.
3 High and persistent unemployment in which inequality increases has a negative effect on subsequent longrun economic growth.
4 Unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions drives people to poverty constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility and erodes selfesteem promoting social dislocation unrest and conflict.

1 For most of human history higher material living standards – full stomachs access to clean water and warmth from fuel – led to better health and longer lives.
2 This pattern of higher incomeslonger lives still holds among poorer countries where life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases but in recent decades it has slowed down among middle income countries and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world.
3 Americans live no longer on average about 77 years in 2004 than Greeks 78 years or New Zealanders 78 though the USA has a higher GDP per capita.
4 Life expectancy in Sweden 80 years and Japan 82 – where income was more equally distributed – was longer.

1 In recent years the characteristic that has strongly correlated with health in developed countries is income inequality.
2 Creating an index of Health and Social Problems from nine factors authors Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett found health and social problems more common in countries with bigger income inequalities and more common among states in the US with larger income inequalities.
3 Other studies have confirmed this relationship.
4 The UNICEF index of child wellbeing in rich countries studying 40 indicators in 22 countries correlates with greater equality but not per capita income.

1 Crime rate has also been shown to be correlated with inequality in society.
2 Most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides – since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions.
3 There have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger.
4 Research has been conducted comparing developed countries with undeveloped countries as well as studying areas within countries.
5 Daly et al.
6 2001 found that among US States and Canadian Provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality.
7 They estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state.

1 Following the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number – economic inequality is problematic.
2 A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five is an example of reduced distributive efficiency within society that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility.
3 An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person such as basic necessities like food water and healthcare while an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person.
4 Thus the marginal utility of wealth per person the additional dollar decreases as a person becomes richer.
5 From this standpoint for any given amount of wealth in society a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility.
6 Some studies have found evidence for this theory noting that in societies where inequality is lower populationwide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.
7 What does the utilitarian principle seek for the greatest number of people?	the greatest good	1
8 An adobe that provides less utility to one person than another is an example of reduced what?	distributive efficiency	2
9 A dollar spent by a poor person is likely to provide what for them?	a great deal of utility	3
10 What the marginal utility of wealth per income per person do as that person becomes richer?	decreases	4
11 What will a society with more equality have?	higher aggregate utility	5
1 Conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption rather than income should be the measure of inequality and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the US.
2 Will Wilkinson of the libertarian Cato Institute states that the weight of the evidence shows that the runup in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality and consumption is more important than income.
3 According to Johnson Smeeding and Tory consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986.
4 The debate is summarized in The Hidden Prosperity of the Poor by journalist Thomas B Edsall.
5 Other studies have not found consumption inequality less dramatic than household income inequality and the CBOs study found consumption data not adequately capturing consumption by highincome households as it does their income though it did agree that household consumption numbers show more equal distribution than household income.
6 What do conservative researchers fell should be a measure of inequality?	consumption	1
7 What political leaning does the Cato Institute have?	libertarian	2

1 Central Banking economist Raghuram Rajan argues that systematic economic inequalities within the United States and around the world have created deep financial fault lines that have made financial crises more likely to happen than in the past – the Financial crisis of 2007–08 being the most recent example.
2 To compensate for stagnating and declining purchasing power political pressure has developed to extend easier credit to the lower and middle income earners – particularly to buy homes – and easier credit in general to keep unemployment rates low.
3 This has given the American economy a tendency to go from bubble to bubble fueled by unsustainable monetary stimulation.
4 What is Raghuram Rajans career?	economist	1
5 What does Rajan feel has created deep financial fault lines?	systematic economic inequalities	1
6 What is the most recent example of financial fault lines?	the Financial crisis of 2007–08	1

1 According to International Monetary Fund economists inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells not the rate of growth.
2 High levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity but also the quality of a countrys institutions and high levels of education.
3 According to IMF staff economists if the income share of the top 20 percent the rich increases then GDP growth actually declines over the medium term suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down.
4 In contrast an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent the poor is associated with higher GDP growth.
5 The poor and the middle class matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic social and political channels.
6 What is negatively correlated to the duration of economic growth?	inequality in wealth and income	1
7 What do high levels of inequality  prevent beyond economic prosperity?	quality of a countrys institutions	2
8 What happens to the GDP growth of a country if the income share of the top 20 percent increases according to IMF staff economists?	declines	3
9 What does an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent of people of a society result in?	higher GDP growth	4
10 Who matters the most for economic growth?	The poor and the middle class	5

1 Economist Joseph Stiglitz presented evidence in 2009 that both global inequality and inequality within countries prevent growth by limiting aggregate demand.
2 Economist Branko Milanovic wrote in 2001 that The view that income inequality harms growth – or that improved equality can help sustain growth – has become more widely held in recent years.
3 .
4 The main reason for this shift is the increasing importance of human capital in development.
5 When physical capital mattered most savings and investments were key.
6 Then it was important to have a large contingent of rich people who could save a greater proportion of their income than the poor and invest it in physical capital.
7 But now that human capital is scarcer than machines widespread education has become the secret to growth.
8 What did Stiglitz present in 2009 regarding global inequality?	evidence	1

1 In 1993 Galor and Zeira showed that inequality in the presence of credit market imperfections has a long lasting detrimental effect on human capital formation and economic development.
2 A 1996 study by Perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth.
3 He showed that in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation education experience and apprenticeship and higher level of fertility and thereby lower levels of growth.
4 He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment.
5 Perotti concluded that more equal societies have lower fertility rates and higher rates of investment in education.
6 Both are reflected in higher rates of growth.
7 Also very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth.
8 When did Galor and Zeria show new information about inequality?	1993	1

12 What do extremely unequal societies tend to be?	politically and socially unstable	7
1 Research by Harvard economist Robert Barro found that there is little overall relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment.
2 According to work by Barro in 1999 and 2000 high levels of inequality reduce growth in relatively poor countries but encourage growth in richer countries.
3 A study of Swedish counties between 1960 and 2000 found a positive impact of inequality on growth with lead times of five years or less but no correlation after ten years.
4 Studies of larger data sets have found no correlations for any fixed lead time and a negative impact on the duration of growth.
5 What does high levels of inequality do to growth in poor countries?	reduce	2
6 What does high levels of inequality do for economic growth in richer countries?	encourage	2
7 Barro found there is little relation between income inequality and rates of what?	growth and investment	1

1 Studies on income inequality and growth have sometimes found evidence confirming the Kuznets curve hypothesis which states that with economic development inequality first increases then decreases.
2 Economist Thomas Piketty challenges this notion claiming that from 1914 to 1945 wars and violent economic and political shocks reduced inequality.
3 Moreover Piketty argues that the magical Kuznets curve hypothesis with its emphasis on the balancing of economic growth in the long run cannot account for the significant increase in economic inequality throughout the developed world since the 1970s.
4 What have studies on income inequality sometimes found evidence confirming?	Kuznets curve hypothesis	1
5 The Kuznets curve says with economic development inequality will decrease after what?	first increases	1
6 Who challenges the notion of the Kuznets curve hypothesis?	Thomas Piketty	2
7 Whats Thomas Pikettys job?	Economist	2
8 What does Piketty feel was the biggest factors in reducing inequality between 1914 to 1945?	wars and violent economic and political shocks	2
1 Some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development.
2 According to a 1955 review savings by the wealthy if these increase with inequality were thought to offset reduced consumer demand.
3 A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality.
4 Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development.
5 Analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth.
6 IMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth.
7 Developing countries with high inequality have succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years but longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution.
8 When were theories developed suggesting inequality may have some positive effect on economic development?	the 1970s	1
9 According to a 1955 review what were savings by the wealthy thought to offset?	reduced consumer demand	2

1 While acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth.
2 The effect of economic growth on poverty reduction – the growth elasticity of poverty – can depend on the existing level of inequality.
3 For instance with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2 per head and 40 of its population living in poverty can halve poverty in ten years but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction.
4 In the words of the Secretary General of the United Nations Ban KiMoon While economic growth is necessary it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty.
5 What needs to be made to ensure poorer members of society can participate in economic growth?	special efforts	1
6 What can the growth elasticity of poverty depend on?	existing level of inequality	2
7 What does it take a country with high inequality longer to achieve?	reduction	3

1 In many poor and developing countries much land and housing is held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system.
2 Much unregistered property is held in informal form through various associations and other arrangements.
3 Reasons for extralegal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape in buying property and building In some countries it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to build on government land.
4 Other causes of extralegal property are failures to notarize transaction documents or having documents notarized but failing to have them recorded with the official agency.
5 What is held outside the formal legal ownership registration system in many developing countries?	much land and housing	1
6 How is unregistered property held in informal form?	through various associations and other arrangements	2
7 Excessive bureaucratic red tape is one of the reasons for what type of ownership?	extralegal	3

1 A number of researchers David Rodda Jacob Vigdor and Janna Matlack argue that a shortage of affordable housing – at least in the US – is caused in part by income inequality.
2 David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991 the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased Rhoda 1994148.
3 Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods for example in East New York rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units.
4 The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace.
5 What do a number of researchers think a shortage of is caused in part by income inequality?	a shortage of affordable housing	1
6 What decreased in number between 1984 and 1991?	quality rental units	2
7 Why did the demand for rentals decrease?	demand for higher quality housing increased	2
8 What drove increased rental prices in East New York?	residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing	3
9 What combined with ricing prices to make it difficult or impossible for poor people to keep pace?	ad valorem property tax policy	4
1 Firstly certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone such as the costs of housing pensions education and health care.
2 If the state does not provide these services then for those on lower incomes the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those who are worse equipped to manage their finances.
3 Secondly aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt.
4 The result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability.
5 How are the certain costs which are difficult to avoid shared?	by everyone	1
6 What are those with lower incomes often unable to manage?	their finances	2
7 What is the term when middle income earners aspire to obtain the same standards of living as people wealthier than themselves?	aspirational consumption	3
8 What is one method of achieving aspirational consumption?	taking on debt	3
9 When people take on debt it leads potentially to what?	economic instability	4
1 The smaller the economic inequality the more waste and pollution is created resulting in many cases in more environmental degradation.
2 This can be explained by the fact that as the poor people in the society become more wealthy it increases their yearly carbon emissions.
3 This relation is expressed by the Environmental Kuznets Curve EKC.
4 not in citation given It should be noted here however that in certain cases with great economic inequality there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the wastepollution is cleaned up better afterwards water treatment filtering  Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier.
5 If there were fewer people however this multiplier would be lower and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well.
6 As such the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well.
7 If as WWF argued population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level 13 of current levels so about 2 billion people human inequality can be addressedcorrected while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage.

1 Socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment financial assets and corporate stock.
2 By contrast the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary.
3 In order to rectify this situation socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product.
4 What is the vast disparities in wealth attributed to by Socialists?	private ownership of the means of production	1
5 What does private ownership create a situation of?	a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income	1
6 What type of income is the vast majority of the population dependent on?	wage or salary	2
7 How do socialists think the means of production should be owned?	socially	3

1 Robert Nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force usually in the form of taxation and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force.
2 However Nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves.
3 John Rawls argued in A Theory of Justice that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole including the poorest members.
4 Rawls does not discuss the full implications of his theory of justice.
5 Some see Rawlss argument as a justification for capitalism since even the poorest members of society theoretically benefit from increased innovations under capitalism others believe only a strong welfare state can satisfy Rawlss theory of justice.
6 Who argues that the government redistributes wealth by force?	Robert Nozick	1
7 What is the usual form of the governments wealth redistribution?	taxation	1
8 In an ideal moral society what would all citizens be free from?	force	1
9 How were some modern economic inequalities created?	forceful taking of property	2

1 The capabilities approach – sometimes called the human development approach – looks at income inequality and poverty as form of “capability deprivation”.
2 Unlike neoliberalism which “defines wellbeing as utility maximization” economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself.
3 Its goal is to “widen people’s choices and the level of their achieved wellbeing” through increasing functionings the things a person values doing capabilities the freedom to enjoy functionings and agency the ability to pursue valued goals.
4 What does the capabilities approach look at poverty as a form of?	capability deprivation	1
5 In the capabilities approach grow and income are considered a means to an end rather than what?	the end itself	2
6 What is the goal of the capabilities approach?	to “widen people’s choices and the level of their achieved wellbeing”	3
7 How would the capabilities approach achieve its goal?	through increasing functionings	3
8 What is the definition of agency as it relates to capabilities?	the ability to pursue valued goals	3
1 When a person’s capabilities are lowered they are in some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise.
2 An old ill man cannot earn as much as a healthy young man gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home.
3 There may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives.
4 As a result income and economic inequality increases and it becomes more difficult to reduce the gap without additional aid.
5 To prevent such inequality this approach believes it’s important to have political freedom economic facilities social opportunities transparency guarantees and protective security to ensure that people aren’t denied their functionings capabilities and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income.
6 What happens when a persons capabilities aer lowered as it relates to their income?	deprived of earning as much	1
7 What can and old ill man not do?	earn as much as a healthy young man	2
8 What issues may prevent women from working outside the home or receiving education?	gender roles and customs	2

1 The original theme was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop with assistance from Dick Mills.
2 The various parts were built up using musique concrète techniques by creating tape loops of an individually struck piano string and individual test oscillators and filters.
3 The Derbyshire arrangement served with minor edits as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 1979–80.
4 It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers.
5 Each note was individually created by cutting splicing speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string white noise and the simple harmonic waveforms of testtone oscillators intended for calibrating equipment and rooms not creating music.
6 New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines.

3 His realm was by this point isolated from the other khanates and controlled most of presentday China and its surrounding areas including modern Mongolia and Korea.
4 It was the first foreign dynasty to rule all of China and lasted until 1368 after which its Genghisid rulers returned to their Mongolian homeland and continued to rule the Northern Yuan dynasty.

1 The system of bureaucracy created by Kublai Khan reflected various cultures in the empire including that of the Han Chinese Khitans Jurchens Mongols and Tibetan Buddhists.
2 While the official terminology of the institutions may indicate the government structure was almost purely that of native Chinese dynasties the Yuan bureaucracy actually consisted of a mix of elements from different cultures.
3 The Chinesestyle elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang Song as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties.
4 Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublais early court and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublais reign.
5 This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil military and censorial offices including the Central Secretariat Zhongshu Sheng to manage civil affairs the Privy Council Chinese 樞密院 to manage military affairs and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection.
6 The actual functions of both central and local government institutions however showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance.
7 Nevertheless such a civilian bureaucracy with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was directly or indirectly responsible for most other governmental agencies such as the traditional Chinesestyle Six Ministries was created in China.
8 At various times another central government institution called the Department of State Affairs Shangshu Sheng that mainly dealt with finance was established such as during the reign of Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong but was usually abandoned shortly afterwards.

1 While the existence of these central government departments and the Six Ministries which had been introduced since the Sui and Tang dynasties gave a Sinicized image in the Yuan administration the actual functions of these ministries also reflected how Mongolian priorities and policies reshaped and redirected those institutions.
2 For example the authority of the Yuan legal system the Ministry of Justice did not extend to legal cases involving Mongols and Semuren who had separate courts of justice.
3 Cases involving members of more than one ethnic group were decided by a mixed board consisting of Chinese and Mongols.
4 Another example was the insignificance of the Ministry of War compared with native Chinese dynasties as the real military authority in Yuan times resided in the Privy Council.
5 Who had military control during the Yuan?	the Privy Council	4
6 When had the Six Ministries existed?	since the Sui and Tang dynasties	1
7 Who were exempt from the Ministry of Justice?	Mongols and Semuren	2

1 Since its invention in 1269 the Phagspa script a unified script for spelling Mongolian Tibetan and Chinese languages was preserved in the court until the end of the dynasty.
2 Most of the Emperors could not master written Chinese but they could generally converse well in the language.
3 The Mongol custom of long standing qudamarriage alliance with Mongol clans the Onggirat and the Ikeres kept the imperial blood purely Mongol until the reign of Tugh Temur whose mother was a Tangut concubine.
4 The Mongol Emperors had built large palaces and pavilions but some still continued to live as nomads at times.
5 Nevertheless a few other Yuan emperors actively sponsored cultural activities an example is Tugh Temur Emperor Wenzong who wrote poetry painted read Chinese classical texts and ordered the compilation of books.
6 When was Phagspa script invented?	1269	1
7 Which languages used the Phagspa script?	Mongolian  Tibetan  and Chinese	1

1 The average Mongol garrison family of the Yuan dynasty seems to have lived a life of decaying rural leisure with income from the harvests of their Chinese tenants eaten up by costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty.
2 The Mongols practiced debt slavery and by 1290 in all parts of the Mongol Empire commoners were selling their children into slavery.
3 Seeing this as damaging to the Mongol nation Kublai in 1291 forbade the sale abroad of Mongols.
4 Kublai wished to persuade the Chinese that he was becoming increasingly sinicized while maintaining his Mongolian credentials with his own people.
5 He set up a civilian administration to rule built a capital within China supported Chinese religions and culture and devised suitable economic and political institutions for the court.
6 But at the same time he never abandoned his Mongolian heritage.
7 By what year was selling children into slavery common among the Mongols?	1290	2
8 When did Kublai ban the international Mongol slave trade?	1291	3
9 How were the Mongol garrison families earning money?	income from the harvests of their Chinese tenants	1
1 In the China of the Yuan or Mongol era various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development including the areas of painting mathematics calligraphy poetry and theater with many great artists and writers being famous today.
2 Due to the coming together of painting poetry and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others.
3 Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting poetry and calligraphy the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together.
4 In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan dynasty there were many famous painters.
5 In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era.
6 In Yuan poetry the main development was the qu which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets.
7 Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time and the other way around with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu.
8 One of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form.
9 One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry painting and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art.
10 Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current vernacular Chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show.
11 Another important consideration regarding Yuan dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in China relatively to works from the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty which have often been better preserved in places such as the Shōsōin in Japan.
12 What type of arts flourished in the Yuan?	painting  mathematics  calligraphy  poetry  and theater	1

1 There were many religions practiced during the Yuan dynasty such as Buddhism Islam and Christianity.
2 The establishment of the Yuan dynasty had dramatically increased the number of Muslims in China.
3 However unlike the western khanates the Yuan dynasty never converted to Islam.
4 Instead Kublai Khan the founder of the Yuan dynasty favored Buddhism especially the Tibetan variants.
5 As a result Tibetan Buddhism was established as the de facto state religion.
6 The toplevel department and government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs Xuanzheng Yuan was set up in Khanbaliq modern Beijing to supervise Buddhist monks throughout the empire.
7 Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism other religions became less important.
8 He and his successors kept a Sakya Imperial Preceptor Dishi at court.
9 Before the end of the Yuan dynasty 14 leaders of the Sakya sect had held the post of Imperial Preceptor thereby enjoying special power.
10 Furthermore Mongol patronage of Buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of Buddhist art.
11 Mongolian Buddhist translations almost all from Tibetan originals began on a large scale after 1300.
12 Many Mongols of the upper class such as the Jalayir and the Oronar nobles as well as the emperors also patronized Confucian scholars and institutions.
13 A considerable number of Confucian and Chinese historical works were translated into the Mongolian language.
14 Which khanates had converted to Islam?	western	3
15 Which religion did Kublai prefer?	Buddhism  especially the Tibetan variants	4

1 Advances in polynomial algebra were made by mathematicians during the Yuan era.
2 The mathematician Zhu Shijie 1249–1314 solved simultaneous equations with up to four unknowns using a rectangular array of coefficients equivalent to modern matrices.
3 Zhu used a method of elimination to reduce the simultaneous equations to a single equation with only one unknown.
4 His method is described in the Jade Mirror of the Four Unknowns written in 1303.
5 The opening pages contain a diagram of Pascals triangle.
6 The summation of a finite arithmetic series is also covered in the book.

1 Guo Shoujing applied mathematics to the construction of calendars.
2 He was one of the first mathematicians in China to work on spherical trigonometry.
3 Gou derived a cubic interpolation formula for his astronomical calculations.
4 His calendar the Shoushi Li 授時暦 or Calendar for Fixing the Seasons was disseminated in 1281 as the official calendar of the Yuan dynasty.
5 The calendar may have been influenced solely by the work of Song dynasty astronomer Shen Kuo or possibly by the work of Arab astronomers.
6 There are no explicit signs of Muslim influences in the Shoushi calendar but Mongol rulers were known to be interested in Muslim calendars.
7 Mathematical knowledge from the Middle East was introduced to China under the Mongols and Muslim astronomers brought Arabic numerals to China in the 13th century.

3 Under the Mongols the practice of Chinese medicine spread to other parts of the empire.
4 Chinese physicians were brought along military campaigns by the Mongols as they expanded towards the west.
5 Chinese medical techniques such as acupuncture moxibustion pulse diagnosis and various herbal drugs and elixirs were transmitted westward to the Middle East and the rest of the empire.
6 Several medical advances were made in the Yuan period.
7 The physician Wei Yilin 1277–1347 invented a suspension method for reducing dislocated joints which he performed using anesthetics.

2 The Nestorian physician Jesus the Interpreter founded the Office of Western Medicine in 1263 during the reign of Kublai.
3 Huihui doctors staffed at two imperial hospitals were responsible for treating the imperial family and members of the court.
4 Chinese physicians opposed Western medicine because its humoral system contradicted the yinyang and wuxing philosophy underlying traditional Chinese medicine.

2 Chinese printing technology was transferred to the Mongols through Kingdom of Qocho and Tibetan intermediaries.
3 Some Yuan documents such as Wang Zhens Nong Shu were printed with earthenware movable type a technology invented in the 12th century.
4 However most published works were still produced through traditional block printing techniques.
5 The publication of a Taoist text inscribed with the name of Töregene Khatun Ögedeis wife is one of the first printed works sponsored by the Mongols.
6 In 1273 the Mongols created the Imperial Library Directorate a governmentsponsored printing office.

3 The Yuan government used woodblocks to print paper money but switched to bronze plates in 1275.
4 The Mongols experimented with establishing the Chinesestyle paper monetary system in Mongolcontrolled territories outside of China.
5 The Yuan minister Bolad was sent to Iran where he explained Yuan paper money to the Ilkhanate court of Gaykhatu.
6 The Ilkhanate government issued paper money in 1294 but public distrust of the exotic new currency doomed the experiment.

1 Politically the system of government created by Kublai Khan was the product of a compromise between Mongolian patrimonial feudalism and the traditional Chinese autocraticbureaucratic system.
2 Nevertheless socially the educated Chinese elite were in general not given the degree of esteem that they had been accorded previously under native Chinese dynasties.
3 Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power the Mongols and the Semuren various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong colonial coloration.
4 The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule.
5 The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century.
6 In general there were very few North Chinese or Southerners reaching the highestpost in the government compared with the possibility that Persians did so in the Ilkhanate.
7 Later the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty also mentioned the discrimination that existed during the Yuan dynasty.
8 In response to an objection against the use of barbarians in his government the Yongle Emperor answered .
9 Discrimination was used by the Mongols during the Yuan dynasty who employed only Mongols and Tartars and discarded northern and southern Chinese and this was precisely the cause that brought disaster upon them.

1 At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands.
2 Han Chinese were moved to Central Asian areas like Besh Baliq Almaliq and Samarqand by the Mongols where they worked as artisans and farmers.
3 Alans were recruited into the Mongol forces with one unit called Right Alan Guard which was combined with recently surrendered soldiers Mongols and Chinese soldiers stationed in the area of the former Kingdom of Qocho and in Besh Balikh the Mongols established a Chinese military colony led by Chinese general Qi Kongzhi Chi Kungchih.
4 After the Mongol conquest of Central Asia by Genghis Khan foreigners were chosen as administrators and comanagement with Chinese and QaraKhitays Khitans of gardens and fields in Samarqand was put upon the Muslims as a requirement since Muslims were not allowed to manage without them.

1 Despite the high position given to Muslims some policies of the Yuan Emperors severely discriminated against them restricting Halal slaughter and other Islamic practices like circumcision as well as Kosher butchering for Jews forcing them to eat food the Mongol way.
2 Toward the end corruption and the persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols.
3 The Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat.
4 Some Muslim communities had a Chinese surname which meant barracks and could also mean thanks.
5 Many Hui Muslims claim this is because that they played an important role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assisting them.
6 During the war fighting the Mongols among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhangs armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng.

1 The historian Frederick W Mote wrote that the usage of the term social classes for this system was misleading and that the position of people within the fourclass system was not an indication of their actual social power and wealth but just entailed degrees of privilege to which they were entitled institutionally and legally so a persons standing within the classes was not a guarantee of their standing since there were rich and well socially standing Chinese while there were less rich Mongol and Semu than there were Mongol and Semu who lived in poverty and were ill treated.

1 The reason for the order of the classes and the reason why people were placed in a certain class was the date they surrendered to the Mongols and had nothing to do with their ethnicity.
2 The earlier they surrendered to the Mongols the higher they were placed the more the held out the lower they were ranked.
3 The Northern Chinese were ranked higher and Southern Chinese were ranked lower because southern China withstood and fought to the last before caving in.

3 The borders of the modern state consequently comprise the crossroads of the NigerCongo NiloSaharan and Afroasiatic areas of the continent representing most major ethnolinguistic groups found in Africa.
4 Bantu and Nilotic populations together constitute around 97 of the nations residents.
5 European and Arab presence in coastal Mombasa dates to the Early Modern period European exploration of the interior began in the 19th century.
6 The British Empire established the East Africa Protectorate in 1895 which starting in 1920 gave way to the Kenya Colony.
7 Kenya obtained independence in December 1963.
8 Following a referendum in August 2010 and adoption of a new constitution Kenya is now divided into 47 semiautonomous counties governed by elected governors.

1 The Republic of Kenya is named after Mount Kenya.
2 The origin of the name Kenya is not clear but perhaps linked to the Kikuyu Embu and Kamba words Kirinyaga Kirenyaa and Kiinyaa which mean Gods resting place in all three languages.
3 If so then the British may not so much have mispronounced it Keenya as misspelled it.
4 Prehistoric volcanic eruptions of Mount Kenya now extinct may have resulted in its association with divinity and creation among the indigenous Bantu ethnic groups who are the native inhabitants of the agricultural land surrounding Mount Kenya.

1 Fossils found in Kenya suggest that primates roamed the area more than 20 million years ago.
2 Recent findings near Lake Turkana indicate that hominids such as Homo habilis 18 and 25 million years ago and Homo erectus 18 million to 350000 years ago are possible direct ancestors of modern Homo sapiens and lived in Kenya in the Pleistocene epoch.
3 During excavations at Lake Turkana in 1984 paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey assisted by Kamoya Kimeu discovered the Turkana Boy a 16millionyearold fossil belonging to Homo erectus.
4 Previous research on early hominids is particularly identified with Mary Leakey and Louis Leakey who were responsible for the preliminary archaeological research at Olorgesailie and Hyrax Hill.
5 Later work at the former site was undertaken by Glynn Isaac.

1 The executive summary of the WG I Summary for Policymakers report says they are certain that emissions resulting from human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases resulting on average in an additional warming of the Earths surface.
2 They calculate with confidence that CO2 has been responsible for over half the enhanced greenhouse effect.
3 They predict that under a business as usual BAU scenario global mean temperature will increase by about 03 °C per decade during the 21st century.
4 They judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 03 to 06 °C over the last 100 years broadly consistent with prediction of climate models but also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability.

1 Former IPCC chairman Robert Watson has said The mistakes all appear to have gone in the direction of making it seem like climate change is more serious by overstating the impact.
2 That is worrying.
3 The IPCC needs to look at this trend in the errors and ask why it happened.
4 Martin Parry a climate expert who had been cochair of the IPCC working group II said that What began with a single unfortunate error over Himalayan glaciers has become a clamour without substance and the IPCC had investigated the other alleged mistakes which were generally unfounded and also marginal to the assessment.

1 The third assessment report TAR prominently featured a graph labeled Millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction based on a 1999 paper by Michael E Mann Raymond S Bradley and Malcolm K Hughes MBH99 which has been referred to as the hockey stick graph.
2 This graph extended the similar graph in Figure 320 from the IPCC Second Assessment Report of 1995 and differed from a schematic in the first assessment report that lacked temperature units but appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years and higher temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period than the mid 20th century.
3 The schematic was not an actual plot of data and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of Medieval vineyards in England.
4 Even with this increase the maximum it showed for the Medieval Warm Period did not reach temperatures recorded in central England in 2007.
5 The MBH99 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by Jones et al.
6 1998 Pollack Huang  Shen 1998 Crowley  Lowery 2000 and Briffa 2000 using differing data and methods.
7 The Jones et al.
8 and Briffa reconstructions were overlaid with the MBH99 reconstruction in Figure 221 of the IPCC report.

1 These studies were widely presented as demonstrating that the current warming period is exceptional in comparison to temperatures between 1000 and 1900 and the MBH99 based graph featured in publicity.
2 Even at the draft stage this finding was disputed by contrarians in May 2000 Fred Singers Science and Environmental Policy Project held a press event on Capitol Hill Washington DC featuring comments on the graph Wibjörn Karlén and Singer argued against the graph at a United States Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation hearing on 18 July 2000.
3 Contrarian John Lawrence Daly featured a modified version of the IPCC 1990 schematic which he misidentified as appearing in the IPCC 1995 report and argued that Overturning its own previous view in the 1995 report the IPCC presented the Hockey Stick as the new orthodoxy with hardly an apology or explanation for the abrupt Uturn since its 1995 report.
4 Criticism of the MBH99 reconstruction in a review paper which was quickly discredited in the Soon and Baliunas controversy was picked up by the Bush administration and a Senate speech by US Republican senator James Inhofe alleged that manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.
5 The data and methodology used to produce the hockey stick graph was criticized in papers by Stephen McIntyre and Ross McKitrick and in turn the criticisms in these papers were examined by other studies and comprehensively refuted by Wahl  Ammann 2007 which showed errors in the methods used by McIntyre and McKitrick.

1 On 23 June 2005 Rep Joe Barton chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce wrote joint letters with Ed Whitfield Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations demanding full records on climate research as well as personal information about their finances and careers from Mann Bradley and Hughes.
2 Sherwood Boehlert chairman of the House Science Committee said this was a misguided and illegitimate investigation apparently aimed at intimidating scientists and at his request the US National Academy of Sciences arranged for its National Research Council to set up a special investigation.
3 The National Research Councils report agreed that there were some statistical failings but these had little effect on the graph which was generally correct.
4 In a 2006 letter to Nature Mann Bradley and Hughes pointed out that their original article had said that more widespread highresolution data are needed before more confident conclusions can be reached and that the uncertainties were the point of the article.

1 On 1 February 2007 the eve of the publication of IPCCs major report on climate a study was published suggesting that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the maximum rates proposed during the last IPCC report in 2001.
2 The study compared IPCC 2001 projections on temperature and sea level change with observations.
3 Over the six years studied the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by IPCCs 2001 projection and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the IPCC projection.
4 When was a study published confirming the 2001 IPCC projections?	1 February 2007	1
5 How did the 2001 IPCC report compare to reality for 20012006?	temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the maximum rates	1
6 How did the 2001 IPCC report compare to reality on temperature levels?	actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given	3
7 How did the 2001 IPCC report compare to reality on sea levels?	actual sea level rise was above the top of the range	3
1 Another example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the IPCC far from overstating dangers and risks have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels.
2 When the researchers analysis was applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 05–14 m 50–140 cm above 1990 levels.
3 These values are much greater than the 9–88 cm as projected by the IPCC itself in its Third Assessment Report published in 2001.
4 This may have been due in part to the expanding human understanding of climate.
5 What danger did the IPCC understate?	projected rises in sea levels	1
6 How much did the IPCC Third Assessment Report say sea levels will rise from 1990 to 2100?	9–88 cm	3
7 How much do researchers now think sea levels will rise from 1990 to 2100?	50–140 cm	2
8 When was the Third Assessment Report published?	2001	3
1 Michael Oppenheimer a longtime participant in the IPCC and coordinating lead author of the Fifth Assessment Report conceded in Science Magazines State of the Planet 20082009 some limitations of the IPCC consensus approach and asks for concurring smaller assessments of special problems instead of the large scale approach as in the previous IPCC assessment reports.
2 It has become more important to provide a broader exploration of uncertainties.
3 Others see as well mixed blessings of the drive for consensus within the IPCC process and ask to include dissenting or minority positions or to improve statements about uncertainties.
4 What role did Michael Oppenheimer have in the IPCCs reports?	coordinating lead author of the Fifth Assessment Report	1
5 Who published the State of the Planet 20082009 report?	Science Magazine	1
6 What approach did Oppenheimer advocate?	concurring  smaller assessments of special problems	1
1 The IPCC process on climate change and its efficiency and success has been compared with dealings with other environmental challenges compare Ozone depletion and global warming.
2 In case of the Ozone depletion global regulation based on the Montreal Protocol has been successful in case of Climate Change the Kyoto Protocol failed.
3 The Ozone case was used to assess the efficiency of the IPCC process.
4 The lockstep situation of the IPCC is having built a broad science consensus while states and governments still follow different if not opposing goals.
5 The underlying linear model of policymaking of more knowledge we have the better the political response will be is being doubted.
6 What has successfully dealt with ozone depletion?	the Montreal Protocol	2
7 What did the Kyoto Protocol try to address?	Climate Change	2
8 Whose goals often still oppose the IPCC?	states and governments	4
1 According to Sheldon Ungars comparison with global warming the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties.
2 The ozone case communicated to lay persons with easytounderstand bridging metaphors derived from the popular culture and related to immediate risks with everyday relevance while the public opinion on climate change sees no imminent danger.
3 The stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts.
4 In case of the IPCC conclusions and the failure of the Kyoto Protocol varying regional costbenefit analysis and burdensharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem.
5 In the UK a report for a House of Lords committee asked to urge the IPCC to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the Stern Review ordered by the UK government made a stronger argument in favor to combat humanmade climate change.
6 Who said people involved in the ozone situation had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties?	Sheldon Ungar	1
7 What remain unsolved problems with the Kyoto Protocol?	varying regional costbenefit analysis and burdensharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions	4
8 What conflicts did the ozone mitigation reduce?	regional burden sharing conflicts	3
9 Who ordered the Stern Review?	the UK government	5
1 Since the IPCC does not carry out its own research it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the reports final release.
2 In principle this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an IPCC report cannot be included.
3 In an area of science where our scientific understanding is rapidly changing this has been raised as a serious shortcoming in a body which is widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science.
4 However there has generally been a steady evolution of key findings and levels of scientific confidence from one assessment report to the next.

1 In February 2010 in response to controversies regarding claims in the Fourth Assessment Report five climate scientists – all contributing or lead IPCC report authors – wrote in the journal Nature calling for changes to the IPCC.
2 They suggested a range of new organizational options from tightening the selection of lead authors and contributors to dumping it in favor of a small permanent body or even turning the whole climate science assessment process into a moderated living WikipediaIPCC.

1 Chloroplasts main role is to conduct photosynthesis where the photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll captures the energy from sunlight and converts it and stores it in the energystorage molecules ATP and NADPH while freeing oxygen from water.
2 They then use the ATP and NADPH to make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process known as the Calvin cycle.
3 Chloroplasts carry out a number of other functions including fatty acid synthesis much amino acid synthesis and the immune response in plants.
4 The number of chloroplasts per cell varies from 1 in algae up to 100 in plants like Arabidopsis and wheat.
5 What is the primary purpose of chloroplasts?	to conduct photosynthesis	1

9 How many chloroplasts per cell does algae have?	1	4
1 Chloroplasts are highly dynamic—they circulate and are moved around within plant cells and occasionally pinch in two to reproduce.
2 Their behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like light color and intensity.
3 Chloroplasts like mitochondria contain their own DNA which is thought to be inherited from their ancestor—a photosynthetic cyanobacterium that was engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell.
4 Chloroplasts cannot be made by the plant cell and must be inherited by each daughter cell during cell division.

9 How do plants get chloroplasts?	must be inherited by each daughter cell during cell division	4
1 Chloroplasts are one of many types of organelles in the plant cell.
2 They are considered to have originated from cyanobacteria through endosymbiosis—when a eukaryotic cell engulfed a photosynthesizing cyanobacterium that became a permanent resident in the cell.
3 Mitochondria are thought to have come from a similar event where an aerobic prokaryote was engulfed.
4 This origin of chloroplasts was first suggested by the Russian biologist Konstantin Mereschkowski in 1905 after Andreas Schimper observed in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resemble cyanobacteria.
5 Chloroplasts are only found in plants and algae.
6 Which organisms have chloroplasts?	plants and algae	5
7 What nationality was Konstantin Mereschkowski?	Russian	4
8 What was Konstantin Mereschkowskis career?	biologist	4
9 When did Konstantin Mereschkowski suggest the origin of chloroplasts?	1905	4
10 Who said chloroplasts are similar to cyanobacteria?	Andreas Schimper	4
1 Cyanobacteria are considered the ancestors of chloroplasts.
2 They are sometimes called bluegreen algae even though they are prokaryotes.
3 They are a diverse phylum of bacteria capable of carrying out photosynthesis and are gramnegative meaning that they have two cell membranes.
4 Cyanobacteria also contain a peptidoglycan cell wall which is thicker than in other gramnegative bacteria and which is located between their two cell membranes.
5 Like chloroplasts they have thylakoids within.
6 On the thylakoid membranes are photosynthetic pigments including chlorophyll a Phycobilins are also common cyanobacterial pigments usually organized into hemispherical phycobilisomes attached to the outside of the thylakoid membranes phycobilins are not shared with all chloroplasts though.
7 What are chloroplasts descended from?	Cyanobacteria	1
8 What type of organism are cyanobacteria?	prokaryotes	2
9 What does gramnegative mean?	they have two cell membranes	3
10 What kind of cell wall do cyanobacteria have?	peptidoglycan	4
11 How are cyanobacteria sometimes wrongly described?	bluegreen algae	2
1 Somewhere around a billion years ago a freeliving cyanobacterium entered an early eukaryotic cell either as food or as an internal parasite but managed to escape the phagocytic vacuole it was contained in.
2 The two innermost lipidbilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacteriums gram negative cell wall and not the phagosomal membrane from the host which was probably lost.
3 The new cellular resident quickly became an advantage providing food for the eukaryotic host which allowed it to live within it.
4 Over time the cyanobacterium was assimilated and many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host.
5 Some of its proteins were then synthesized in the cytoplasm of the host cell and imported back into the chloroplast formerly the cyanobacterium.
6 What kind of cell did cynaobacteria enter long ago?	eukaryotic	1
7 How long ago did cyanobacteria enter a cell?	around a billion years ago	1
8 What surrounds chloroplasts?	two innermost lipidbilayer membranes	2
9 What kind of membrane came from the host?	phagosomal	2
10 What happened when cyanobacteria was assimilated?	many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host	4
1 These chloroplasts which can be traced back directly to a cyanobacterial ancestor are known as primary plastids plastid in this context means almost the same thing as chloroplast.
2 All primary chloroplasts belong to one of three chloroplast lineages—the glaucophyte chloroplast lineage the rhodophyte or red algal chloroplast lineage or the chloroplastidan or green chloroplast lineage.
3 The second two are the largest and the green chloroplast lineage is the one that contains the land plants.
4 What does plastid mean?	almost the same thing as chloroplast	1
5 How many chloroplast lineages are there?	three	2
6 What does rhodophyte mean?	red algal chloroplast	2
7 What does chloroplastidan mean?	green chloroplast	2
8 Which lineage includes land plants?	the green chloroplast lineage	3
1 The alga Cyanophora a glaucophyte is thought to be one of the first organisms to contain a chloroplast.
2 The glaucophyte chloroplast group is the smallest of the three primary chloroplast lineages being found in only 13 species and is thought to be the one that branched off the earliest.
3 Glaucophytes have chloroplasts that retain a peptidoglycan wall between their double membranes like their cyanobacterial parent.
4 For this reason glaucophyte chloroplasts are also known as muroplasts.
5 Glaucophyte chloroplasts also contain concentric unstacked thylakoids which surround a carboxysome  an icosahedral structure that glaucophyte chloroplasts and cyanobacteria keep their carbon fixation enzyme rubisco in.
6 The starch that they synthesize collects outside the chloroplast.
7 Like cyanobacteria glaucophyte chloroplast thylakoids are studded with light collecting structures called phycobilisomes.
8 For these reasons glaucophyte chloroplasts are considered a primitive intermediate between cyanobacteria and the more evolved chloroplasts in red algae and plants.
9 What chloroplast lineage is Cyanophora in?	glaucophyte	1
10 What kind of organism is Cyanophora?	alga	1
11 What are muroplasts?	glaucophyte chloroplasts	4
12 What do concentric unstacked thylakoids surround?	a carboxysome	5
13 What kind of structure is a carboxysome?	icosahedral	5
1 Rhodoplasts have a double membrane with an intermembrane space and phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes on the thylakoid membranes preventing their thylakoids from stacking.
2 Some contain pyrenoids.
3 Rhodoplasts have chlorophyll a and phycobilins for photosynthetic pigments the phycobilin phycoerytherin is responsible for giving many red algae their distinctive red color.
4 However since they also contain the bluegreen chlorophyll a and other pigments many are reddish to purple from the combination.
5 The red phycoerytherin pigment is an adaptation to help red algae catch more sunlight in deep water—as such some red algae that live in shallow water have less phycoerytherin in their rhodoplasts and can appear more greenish.
6 Rhodoplasts synthesize a form of starch called floridean which collects into granules outside the rhodoplast in the cytoplasm of the red alga.
7 What kinds of pigments do rhodoplasts have?	chlorophyll a and phycobilins	3
8 What are rhodoplasts phycobilin pigments combined into?	phycobilisomes	1
9 What makes red algae red?	the phycobilin phycoerytherin	3
10 What is the benefit of red algae being red?	catch more sunlight in deep water	5
11 What is floridean?	a form of starch	6
1 The chloroplastidan chloroplasts or green chloroplasts are another large highly diverse primary chloroplast lineage.
2 Their host organisms are commonly known as the green algae and land plants.
3 They differ from glaucophyte and red algal chloroplasts in that they have lost their phycobilisomes and contain chlorophyll b instead.
4 Most green chloroplasts are obviously green though some arent like some forms of Hæmatococcus pluvialis due to accessory pigments that override the chlorophylls green colors.
5 Chloroplastidan chloroplasts have lost the peptidoglycan wall between their double membrane and have replaced it with an intermembrane space.
6 Some plants seem to have kept the genes for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer though theyve been repurposed for use in chloroplast division instead.
7 What do red algal chloroplasts have that green chloroplasts dont?	phycobilisomes	3
8 Why arent some forms of Hæmatococcus pluvialis green?	accessory pigments that override the chlorophylls green colors	4
9 What dont chloroplastidan chloroplasts have?	the peptidoglycan wall	5
10 What have some plants repurposed the peptidoglycan layer genes for?	chloroplast division	6
11 What do green chloroplasts have instead of phycobilisomes?	chlorophyll b	3
1 While primary chloroplasts have a double membrane from their cyanobacterial ancestor secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside of the original two as a result of the secondary endosymbiotic event when a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed a chloroplastcontaining alga but failed to digest it—much like the cyanobacterium at the beginning of this story.
2 The engulfed alga was broken down leaving only its chloroplast and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus forming a chloroplast with three or four membranes—the two cyanobacterial membranes sometimes the eaten algas cell membrane and the phagosomal vacuole from the hosts cell membrane.
3 What kind of membrane do primary chloroplasts have?	double	1
4 What differs about secondary chloroplasts membranes?	additional membranes outside of the original two	1
5 What was the secondary endosymbiotic event?	a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed a chloroplastcontaining alga but failed to digest it	1
6 What additional membranes do secondary chloroplasts have?	sometimes the eaten algas cell membrane  and the phagosomal vacuole from the hosts cell membrane	2
7 What was left when engulfed algae was broken down?	its chloroplast  and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus	2
1 Euglenophytes are a group of common flagellated protists that contain chloroplasts derived from a green alga.
2 Euglenophyte chloroplasts have three membranes—it is thought that the membrane of the primary endosymbiont was lost leaving the cyanobacterial membranes and the secondary hosts phagosomal membrane.
3 Euglenophyte chloroplasts have a pyrenoid and thylakoids stacked in groups of three.
4 Starch is stored in the form of paramylon which is contained in membranebound granules in the cytoplasm of the euglenophyte.
5 What kind of chloroplasts do Euglenophytes have?	chloroplasts derived from a green alga	1
6 What kind of protists are Euglenophytes?	common flagellated	1
7 How are the pyrenoid and thylakoids arranged?	stacked in groups of three	3
8 What does paramylon store?	Starch	4
9 Which membrane was lost in euglenophyte chloroplasts?	the membrane of the primary endosymbiont	2
1 Cryptophytes or cryptomonads are a group of algae that contain a redalgal derived chloroplast.
2 Cryptophyte chloroplasts contain a nucleomorph that superficially resembles that of the chlorarachniophytes.
3 Cryptophyte chloroplasts have four membranes the outermost of which is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
4 They synthesize ordinary starch which is stored in granules found in the periplastid space—outside the original double membrane in the place that corresponds to the red algas cytoplasm.
5 Inside cryptophyte chloroplasts is a pyrenoid and thylakoids in stacks of two.
6 What is another word for cryptophytes?	cryptomonads	1
7 What kind of chloroplasts do cryptophytes have?	redalgal derived chloroplast	1
8 What part of cryptophyte chloroplasts is similar to chlorarachniophytes?	nucleomorph	2

10 How do cryptophyte chloroplasts arrange their pyrenoid and thylakoids?	stacks of two	5
1 Apicomplexans are another group of chromalveolates.
2 Like the helicosproidia theyre parasitic and have a nonphotosynthetic chloroplast.
3 They were once thought to be related to the helicosproidia but it is now known that the helicosproida are green algae rather than chromalveolates.
4 The apicomplexans include Plasmodium the malaria parasite.
5 Many apicomplexans keep a vestigial red algal derived chloroplast called an apicoplast which they inherited from their ancestors.
6 Other apicomplexans like Cryptosporidium have lost the chloroplast completely.
7 Apicomplexans store their energy in amylopectin starch granules that are located in their cytoplasm even though they are nonphotosynthetic.
8 What are Apicomplexans similar to?	helicosproidia	2
9 What are Apicomplexans a type of?	chromalveolates	1
10 What is Plasmodium?	the malaria parasite	4
11 What is an apicoplast?	a vestigial red algal derived chloroplast	5
12 Where do Apicomplexans store energy?	in amylopectin starch granules that are located in their cytoplasm	7
1 Apicoplasts have lost all photosynthetic function and contain no photosynthetic pigments or true thylakoids.
2 They are bounded by four membranes but the membranes are not connected to the endoplasmic reticulum.
3 The fact that apicomplexans still keep their nonphotosynthetic chloroplast around demonstrates how the chloroplast carries out important functions other than photosynthesis.
4 Plant chloroplasts provide plant cells with many important things besides sugar and apicoplasts are no different—they synthesize fatty acids isopentenyl pyrophosphate ironsulfur clusters and carry out part of the heme pathway.
5 This makes the apicoplast an attractive target for drugs to cure apicomplexanrelated diseases.
6 The most important apicoplast function is isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis—in fact apicomplexans die when something interferes with this apicoplast function and when apicomplexans are grown in an isopentenyl pyrophosphaterich medium they dump the organelle.
7 What do apicoplasts synthesize?	fatty acids  isopentenyl pyrophosphate  ironsulfur clusters	4
8 What kind of diseases do drugs target apicoplasts for?	apicomplexanrelated diseases	5
9 What is the most important thing apicoplasts do?	isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis	6
10 What are apicoplasts missing?	photosynthetic pigments or true thylakoids	1
11 How many membranes do apicoplasts have?	four	2
1 The most common dinophyte chloroplast is the peridinintype chloroplast characterized by the carotenoid pigment peridinin in their chloroplasts along with chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c2.
2 Peridinin is not found in any other group of chloroplasts.
3 The peridinin chloroplast is bounded by three membranes occasionally two having lost the red algal endosymbionts original cell membrane.
4 The outermost membrane is not connected to the endoplasmic reticulum.
5 They contain a pyrenoid and have tripletstacked thylakoids.
6 Starch is found outside the chloroplast An important feature of these chloroplasts is that their chloroplast DNA is highly reduced and fragmented into many small circles.
7 Most of the genome has migrated to the nucleus and only critical photosynthesisrelated genes remain in the chloroplast.
8 What is only found in peridinintype chloroplasts?	Peridinin	2
9 Where is Peridinin found?	peridinintype chloroplast	1
10 How are peridinintype chloroplasts thylakoids arranged?	tripletstacked	5
11 What have peridinintype chloroplasts lost?	the red algal endosymbionts original cell membrane	3
1 The fucoxanthin dinophyte lineages including Karlodinium and Karenia lost their original red algal derived chloroplast and replaced it with a new chloroplast derived from a haptophyte endosymbiont.
2 Karlodinium and Karenia probably took up different heterokontophytes.
3 Because the haptophyte chloroplast has four membranes tertiary endosymbiosis would be expected to create a six membraned chloroplast adding the haptophytes cell membrane and the dinophytes phagosomal vacuole.
4 However the haptophyte was heavily reduced stripped of a few membranes and its nucleus leaving only its chloroplast with its original double membrane and possibly one or two additional membranes around it.
5 What lineage is Karlodinium in?	fucoxanthin dinophyte	1
6 What lineage is Karenia in?	fucoxanthin dinophyte	1
7 How many membranes does the haptophyte chloroplast have?	four	3
8 What is tertiary endosymbiosis of haptophyte chloroplasts expected to create?	a six membraned chloroplast	3
1 Members of the genus Dinophysis have a phycobilincontaining chloroplast taken from a cryptophyte.
2 However the cryptophyte is not an endosymbiont—only the chloroplast seems to have been taken and the chloroplast has been stripped of its nucleomorph and outermost two membranes leaving just a twomembraned chloroplast.
3 Cryptophyte chloroplasts require their nucleomorph to maintain themselves and Dinophysis species grown in cell culture alone cannot survive so it is possible but not confirmed that the Dinophysis chloroplast is a kleptoplast—if so Dinophysis chloroplasts wear out and Dinophysis species must continually engulf cryptophytes to obtain new chloroplasts to replace the old ones.
4 Where did Dinophysis get its chloroplasts from?	a cryptophyte	1
5 What have the Dinophysis chloroplasts lost?	its nucleomorph and outermost two membranes	2
6 What is the chloroplast of Dinophysis?	a phycobilincontaining chloroplast	1
7 What is left of the Dinophysis chloroplasts?	a twomembraned chloroplast	2
1 Some dinophytes like Kryptoperidinium and Durinskia have a diatom heterokontophyte derived chloroplast.
2 These chloroplasts are bounded by up to five membranes depending on whether you count the entire diatom endosymbiont as the chloroplast or just the red algal derived chloroplast inside it.
3 The diatom endosymbiont has been reduced relatively little—it still retains its original mitochondria and has endoplasmic reticulum ribosomes a nucleus and of course red algal derived chloroplasts—practically a complete cell all inside the hosts endoplasmic reticulum lumen.
4 However the diatom endosymbiont cant store its own food—its starch is found in granules in the dinophyte hosts cytoplasm instead.
5 The diatom endosymbionts nucleus is present but it probably cant be called a nucleomorph because it shows no sign of genome reduction and might have even been expanded.
6 Diatoms have been engulfed by dinoflagellates at least three times.
7 What is another word for diatom?	heterokontophyte	1
8 What is Durinskias chloroplast?	a diatom heterokontophyte derived chloroplast	1
9 How many membranes does Durinskias chloroplast have?	up to five	2
10 What is sometimes but not always counted regarding Durinskias chloroplast membranes?	the entire diatom endosymbiont as the chloroplast	2
11 Where does the diatom endosymbiont store starch?	granules in the dinophyte hosts cytoplasm	4
1 Lepidodinium viride and its close relatives are dinophytes that lost their original peridinin chloroplast and replaced it with a green algal derived chloroplast more specifically a prasinophyte.
2 Lepidodinium is the only dinophyte that has a chloroplast thats not from the rhodoplast lineage.
3 The chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and has no nucleomorph—all the nucleomorph genes have been transferred to the dinophyte nucleus.
4 The endosymbiotic event that led to this chloroplast was serial secondary endosymbiosis rather than tertiary endosymbiosis—the endosymbiont was a green alga containing a primary chloroplast making a secondary chloroplast.
5 Where do nucleomorph genes transfer to?	the dinophyte nucleus	3
6 What is the only dinophyte that has a nonrhodoplast chloroplast?	Lepidodinium	2
7 What did Lepidodinium viride lose?	their original peridinin chloroplast	1
8 What did Lepidodinium viride replace their original chloroplast with?	a green algal derived chloroplast	1
9 What is a prasinophyte?	a green algal derived chloroplast	1
1 While most chloroplasts originate from that first set of endosymbiotic events Paulinella chromatophora is an exception that acquired a photosynthetic cyanobacterial endosymbiont more recently.
2 It is not clear whether that symbiont is closely related to the ancestral chloroplast of other eukaryotes.
3 Being in the early stages of endosymbiosis Paulinella chromatophora can offer some insights into how chloroplasts evolved.
4 Paulinella cells contain one or two sausage shaped bluegreen photosynthesizing structures called chromatophores descended from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus.
5 Chromatophores cannot survive outside their host.
6 Chromatophore DNA is about a million base pairs long containing around 850 protein encoding genes—far less than the three million base pair Synechococcus genome but much larger than the approximately 150000 base pair genome of the more assimilated chloroplast.
7 Chromatophores have transferred much less of their DNA to the nucleus of their host.
8 About 03–08 of the nuclear DNA in Paulinella is from the chromatophore compared with 11–14 from the chloroplast in plants.

1 Chloroplasts have their own DNA often abbreviated as ctDNA or cpDNA.
2 It is also known as the plastome.
3 Its existence was first proved in 1962 and first sequenced in 1986—when two Japanese research teams sequenced the chloroplast DNA of liverwort and tobacco.
4 Since then hundreds of chloroplast DNAs from various species have been sequenced but theyre mostly those of land plants and green algae—glaucophytes red algae and other algal groups are extremely underrepresented potentially introducing some bias in views of typical chloroplast DNA structure and content.

1 The inverted repeat regions are highly conserved among land plants and accumulate few mutations.
2 Similar inverted repeats exist in the genomes of cyanobacteria and the other two chloroplast lineages glaucophyta and rhodophyceæ suggesting that they predate the chloroplast though some chloroplast DNAs have since lost or flipped the inverted repeats making them direct repeats.
3 It is possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome as chloroplast DNAs which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get rearranged more.
4 What seldom mutates?	The inverted repeat regions	1
5 What have some inverted repeats become?	direct repeats	2
6 What could inverted repeats help do?	stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome	3
1 The mechanism for chloroplast DNA cpDNA replication has not been conclusively determined but two main models have been proposed.
2 Scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s.
3 The results of the microscopy experiments led to the idea that chloroplast DNA replicates using a double displacement loop Dloop.
4 As the Dloop moves through the circular DNA it adopts a theta intermediary form also known as a Cairns replication intermediate and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism.
5 Transcription starts at specific points of origin.
6 Multiple replication forks open up allowing replication machinery to transcribe the DNA.
7 As replication continues the forks grow and eventually converge.
8 The new cpDNA structures separate creating daughter cpDNA chromosomes.
9 How is chloroplast replication observed?	electron microscopy	2
10 How many major chloroplast replication models have been suggested?	two	1
11 What is a Cairns replication intermediate?	a theta intermediary form	4
12 What is a Dloop?	a Cairns replication intermediate	4
13 How does the Dloop finish replicating?	with a rolling circle mechanism	4
1 In cpDNA there are several A → G deamination gradients.
2 DNA becomes susceptible to deamination events when it is single stranded.
3 When replication forks form the strand not being copied is single stranded and thus at risk for A → G deamination.
4 Therefore gradients in deamination indicate that replication forks were most likely present and the direction that they initially opened the highest gradient is most likely nearest the start site because it was single stranded for the longest amount of time.
5 This mechanism is still the leading theory today however a second theory suggests that most cpDNA is actually linear and replicates through homologous recombination.
6 It further contends that only a minority of the genetic material is kept in circular chromosomes while the rest is in branched linear or other complex structures.
7 What kind of gradients does cpDNA have?	A → G deamination	1
8 What makes DNA vulnerable to deamination?	when it is single stranded	2
9 How does the secondary theory say most cpDNA is structured?	linear	5
10 How does the secondary theory say most cpDNA replicates?	homologous recombination	5
11 Where does the secondary theory say most genes are kept?	in branched  linear  or other complex structures	6
1 One of competing model for cpDNA replication asserts that most cpDNA is linear and participates in homologous recombination and replication structures similar to bacteriophage T4.
2 It has been established that some plants have linear cpDNA such as maize and that more species still contain complex structures that scientists do not yet understand.
3 When the original experiments on cpDNA were performed scientists did notice linear structures however they attributed these linear forms to broken circles.
4 If the branched and complex structures seen in cpDNA experiments are real and not artifacts of concatenated circular DNA or broken circles then a Dloop mechanism of replication is insufficient to explain how those structures would replicate.
5 At the same time homologous recombination does not expand the multiple A  G gradients seen in plastomes.
6 Because of the failure to explain the deamination gradient as well as the numerous plant species that have been shown to have circular cpDNA the predominant theory continues to hold that most cpDNA is circular and most likely replicates via a D loop mechanism.
7 What is cpDNAs replication similar to?	bacteriophage T4	1
8 What kind of cpDNA does maize have?	linear	2
9 How is most plants cpDNA arranged?	circular	6
10 How does most plants cpDNA replicate?	via a D loop mechanism	6
1 Endosymbiotic gene transfer is how we know about the lost chloroplasts in many chromalveolate lineages.
2 Even if a chloroplast is eventually lost the genes it donated to the former hosts nucleus persist providing evidence for the lost chloroplasts existence.
3 For example while diatoms a heterokontophyte now have a red algal derived chloroplast the presence of many green algal genes in the diatom nucleus provide evidence that the diatom ancestor probably the ancestor of all chromalveolates too had a green algal derived chloroplast at some point which was subsequently replaced by the red chloroplast.
4 What shows us lost chloroplasts?	Endosymbiotic gene transfer	1
5 What do donated genes give evidence of?	the lost chloroplasts existence	2

7 What kind of chloroplasts did diatoms have but lost?	green algal derived chloroplast	3
1 Curiously around half of the protein products of transferred genes arent even targeted back to the chloroplast.
2 Many became exaptations taking on new functions like participating in cell division protein routing and even disease resistance.
3 A few chloroplast genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome—most became nonfunctional pseudogenes though a few tRNA genes still work in the mitochondrion.
4 Some transferred chloroplast DNA protein products get directed to the secretory pathway though it should be noted that many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the hosts cell membrane and therefore topologically outside of the cell because to reach the chloroplast from the cytosol you have to cross the cell membrane just like if you were headed for the extracellular space.
5 In those cases chloroplasttargeted proteins do initially travel along the secretory pathway.
6 What is the status of most chloroplast genes in the mitochondrion?	nonfunctional pseudogenes	3
7 How much of the protein products of transferred genes dont go back to chloroplasts?	around half	1

9 What do you have to cross to reach the chloroplast in many secondary plastids?	the cell membrane	4
1 After a chloroplast polypeptide is synthesized on a ribosome in the cytosol an enzyme specific to chloroplast proteins phosphorylates or adds a phosphate group to many but not all of them in their transit sequences.
2 Phosphorylation helps many proteins bind the polypeptide keeping it from folding prematurely.
3 This is important because it prevents chloroplast proteins from assuming their active form and carrying out their chloroplast functions in the wrong place—the cytosol.
4 At the same time they have to keep just enough shape so that they can be recognized by the chloroplast.
5 These proteins also help the polypeptide get imported into the chloroplast.
6 What is the chloroplast polypeptide synthesized on?	a ribosome	1
7 Where is the chloroplast polypeptide synthesized?	in the cytosol	1

9 What is the benefit of polypeptide binding?	keeping it from folding prematurely	2
1 In land plants chloroplasts are generally lensshaped 5–8 μm in diameter and 1–3 μm thick.
2 Greater diversity in chloroplast shapes exists among the algae which often contain a single chloroplast that can be shaped like a net eg Oedogonium a cup eg Chlamydomonas a ribbonlike spiral around the edges of the cell eg Spirogyra or slightly twisted bands at the cell edges eg Sirogonium.
3 Some algae have two chloroplasts in each cell they are starshaped in Zygnema or may follow the shape of half the cell in order Desmidiales.
4 In some algae the chloroplast takes up most of the cell with pockets for the nucleus and other organelles for example some species of Chlorella have a cupshaped chloroplast that occupies much of the cell.

9 What shape is Chlamydomonass chloroplasts?	a cup	2
1 There are some common misconceptions about the outer and inner chloroplast membranes.
2 The fact that chloroplasts are surrounded by a double membrane is often cited as evidence that they are the descendants of endosymbiotic cyanobacteria.
3 This is often interpreted as meaning the outer chloroplast membrane is the product of the hosts cell membrane infolding to form a vesicle to surround the ancestral cyanobacterium—which is not true—both chloroplast membranes are homologous to the cyanobacteriums original double membranes.
4 What is evidence chloroplasts descended from endosymbiotic cyanobacteria?	a double membrane	2
5 What is incorrectly thought about the outer chloroplast membrane?	the product of the hosts cell membrane infolding to form a vesicle to surround the ancestral cyanobacterium	3
6 How do both chloroplast membranes compare to cyanobacteriums original double membranes?	homologous	3
1 The chloroplast double membrane is also often compared to the mitochondrial double membrane.
2 This is not a valid comparison—the inner mitochondria membrane is used to run proton pumps and carry out oxidative phosphorylation across to generate ATP energy.
3 The only chloroplast structure that can considered analogous to it is the internal thylakoid system.
4 Even so in terms of inout the direction of chloroplast H ion flow is in the opposite direction compared to oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria.
5 In addition in terms of function the inner chloroplast membrane which regulates metabolite passage and synthesizes some materials has no counterpart in the mitochondrion.

10 What part of chloroplasts isnt similar to mitochondria?	the inner chloroplast membrane	5
1 The chloroplast membranes sometimes protrude out into the cytoplasm forming a stromule or stromacontaining tubule.
2 Stromules are very rare in chloroplasts and are much more common in other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts in petals and roots respectively.
3 They may exist to increase the chloroplasts surface area for crossmembrane transport because they are often branched and tangled with the endoplasmic reticulum.
4 When they were first observed in 1962 some plant biologists dismissed the structures as artifactual claiming that stromules were just oddly shaped chloroplasts with constricted regions or dividing chloroplasts.
5 However there is a growing body of evidence that stromules are functional integral features of plant cell plastids not merely artifacts.
6 What are more common in other plastids than chloroplasts?	Stromules	2

1 Some chloroplasts contain a structure called the chloroplast peripheral reticulum.
2 It is often found in the chloroplasts of C4 plants though it has also been found in some C3 angiosperms and even some gymnosperms.
3 The chloroplast peripheral reticulum consists of a maze of membranous tubes and vesicles continuous with the inner chloroplast membrane that extends into the internal stromal fluid of the chloroplast.
4 Its purpose is thought to be to increase the chloroplasts surface area for crossmembrane transport between its stroma and the cell cytoplasm.
5 The small vesicles sometimes observed may serve as transport vesicles to shuttle stuff between the thylakoids and intermembrane space.

1 Chloroplasts have their own ribosomes which they use to synthesize a small fraction of their proteins.
2 Chloroplast ribosomes are about twothirds the size of cytoplasmic ribosomes around 17 nm vs 25 nm.
3 They take mRNAs transcribed from the chloroplast DNA and translate them into protein.
4 While similar to bacterial ribosomes chloroplast translation is more complex than in bacteria so chloroplast ribosomes include some chloroplastunique features.
5 Small subunit ribosomal RNAs in several Chlorophyta and euglenid chloroplasts lack motifs for shinedalgarno sequence recognition which is considered essential for translation initiation in most chloroplasts and prokaryotes.
6 Such loss is also rarely observed in other plastids and prokaryotes.

1 Plastoglobuli singular plastoglobulus sometimes spelled plastoglobules are spherical bubbles of lipids and proteins about 45–60 nanometers across.
2 They are surrounded by a lipid monolayer.
3 Plastoglobuli are found in all chloroplasts but become more common when the chloroplast is under oxidative stress or when it ages and transitions into a gerontoplast.
4 Plastoglobuli also exhibit a greater size variation under these conditions.
5 They are also common in etioplasts but decrease in number as the etioplasts mature into chloroplasts.

1 Plastoglobuli were once thought to be freefloating in the stroma but it is now thought that they are permanently attached either to a thylakoid or to another plastoglobulus attached to a thylakoid a configuration that allows a plastoglobulus to exchange its contents with the thylakoid network.
2 In normal green chloroplasts the vast majority of plastoglobuli occur singularly attached directly to their parent thylakoid.
3 In old or stressed chloroplasts plastoglobuli tend to occur in linked groups or chains still always anchored to a thylakoid.

1 The chloroplasts of some hornworts and algae contain structures called pyrenoids.
2 They are not found in higher plants.
3 Pyrenoids are roughly spherical and highly refractive bodies which are a site of starch accumulation in plants that contain them.
4 They consist of a matrix opaque to electrons surrounded by two hemispherical starch plates.
5 The starch is accumulated as the pyrenoids mature.
6 In algae with carbon concentrating mechanisms the enzyme rubisco is found in the pyrenoids.
7 Starch can also accumulate around the pyrenoids when CO2 is scarce.
8 Pyrenoids can divide to form new pyrenoids or be produced de novo.

1 In the helical thylakoid model grana consist of a stack of flattened circular granal thylakoids that resemble pancakes.
2 Each granum can contain anywhere from two to a hundred thylakoids though grana with 10–20 thylakoids are most common.
3 Wrapped around the grana are helicoid stromal thylakoids also known as frets or lamellar thylakoids.
4 The helices ascend at an angle of 20–25° connecting to each granal thylakoid at a bridgelike slit junction.
5 The helicoids may extend as large sheets that link multiple grana or narrow to tubelike bridges between grana.
6 While different parts of the thylakoid system contain different membrane proteins the thylakoid membranes are continuous and the thylakoid space they enclose form a single continuous labyrinth.

1 Embedded in the thylakoid membranes are important protein complexes which carry out the light reactions of photosynthesis.
2 Photosystem II and photosystem I contain lightharvesting complexes with chlorophyll and carotenoids that absorb light energy and use it to energize electrons.
3 Molecules in the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space decreasing the pH and turning it acidic.
4 ATP synthase is a large protein complex that harnesses the concentration gradient of the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space to generate ATP energy as the hydrogen ions flow back out into the stroma—much like a dam turbine.

1 There are two types of thylakoids—granal thylakoids which are arranged in grana and stromal thylakoids which are in contact with the stroma.
2 Granal thylakoids are pancakeshaped circular disks about 300–600 nanometers in diameter.
3 Stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana.
4 The flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat photosystem II protein complex.
5 This allows them to stack tightly forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane called granal membrane increasing stability and surface area for light capture.
6 How many types of thylakoids are there?	two	1

10 How large are granal thylakoids?	about 300–600 nanometers in diameter	2
1 In addition to chlorophylls another group of yellow–orange pigments called carotenoids are also found in the photosystems.
2 There are about thirty photosynthetic carotenoids.
3 They help transfer and dissipate excess energy and their bright colors sometimes override the chlorophyll green like during the fall when the leaves of some land plants change color.
4 βcarotene is a bright redorange carotenoid found in nearly all chloroplasts like chlorophyll a Xanthophylls especially the orangered zeaxanthin are also common.

1 Phycobilins are a third group of pigments found in cyanobacteria and glaucophyte red algal and cryptophyte chloroplasts.
2 Phycobilins come in all colors though phycoerytherin is one of the pigments that makes many red algae red.
3 Phycobilins often organize into relatively large protein complexes about 40 nanometers across called phycobilisomes.
4 Like photosystem I and ATP synthase phycobilisomes jut into the stroma preventing thylakoid stacking in red algal chloroplasts.
5 Cryptophyte chloroplasts and some cyanobacteria dont have their phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes and keep them in their thylakoid space instead.

10 How big are phycobilisomes?	about 40 nanometers across	3
1 To fix carbon dioxide into sugar molecules in the process of photosynthesis chloroplasts use an enzyme called rubisco.
2 Rubisco has a problem—it has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen so at high oxygen concentrations rubisco starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors.
3 This has the end result of ATP energy being wasted and CO2 being released all with no sugar being produced.
4 This is a big problem since O2 is produced by the initial light reactions of photosynthesis causing issues down the line in the Calvin cycle which uses rubisco.
5 What do chloroplasts use to fix carbon dioxide into sugar?	an enzyme called rubisco	1
6 What is rubiscos flaw?	it has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen	2

8 What process down the line does rubiscos flaw interfere with?	the Calvin cycle	4
9 What is wasted by rubiscos flaw?	ATP energy	3
1 As a result chloroplasts in C4 mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells are specialized for each stage of photosynthesis.
2 In mesophyll cells chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions so they lack rubisco and have normal grana and thylakoids which they use to make ATP and NADPH as well as oxygen.
3 They store CO2 in a fourcarbon compound which is why the process is called C4 photosynthesis.
4 The fourcarbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath chloroplasts where it drops off CO2 and returns to the mesophyll.
5 Bundle sheath chloroplasts do not carry out the light reactions preventing oxygen from building up in them and disrupting rubisco activity.
6 Because of this they lack thylakoids organized into grana stacks—though bundle sheath chloroplasts still have freefloating thylakoids in the stroma where they still carry out cyclic electron flow a lightdriven method of synthesizing ATP to power the Calvin cycle without generating oxygen.
7 They lack photosystem II and only have photosystem I—the only protein complex needed for cyclic electron flow.
8 Because the job of bundle sheath chloroplasts is to carry out the Calvin cycle and make sugar they often contain large starch grains.
9 What are chloroplasts in mesophyll cells specialized for?	light reactions	2

3 The plant cells which contain chloroplasts are usually parenchyma cells though chloroplasts can also be found in collenchyma tissue.
4 A plant cell which contains chloroplasts is known as a chlorenchyma cell.

1 In some plants such as cacti chloroplasts are found in the stems though in most plants chloroplasts are concentrated in the leaves.
2 One square millimeter of leaf tissue can contain half a million chloroplasts.
3 Within a leaf chloroplasts are mainly found in the mesophyll layers of a leaf and the guard cells of stomata.
4 Palisade mesophyll cells can contain 30–70 chloroplasts per cell while stomatal guard cells contain only around 8–15 per cell as well as much less chlorophyll.
5 Chloroplasts can also be found in the bundle sheath cells of a leaf especially in C4 plants which carry out the Calvin cycle in their bundle sheath cells.
6 They are often absent from the epidermis of a leaf.

1 The chloroplasts of plant and algal cells can orient themselves to best suit the available light.
2 In lowlight conditions they will spread out in a sheet—maximizing the surface area to absorb light.
3 Under intense light they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cells cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edgeon.
4 This reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage.
5 This ability to distribute chloroplasts so that they can take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones.
6 Chloroplast movement is considered one of the most closely regulated stimulusresponse systems that can be found in plants.
7 Mitochondria have also been observed to follow chloroplasts as they move.
8 When do chloroplasts spread out flat?	lowlight conditions	2
9 When do chloroplasts arrange in vertical columns or turn sideways?	Under intense light	3

1 Plants have two main immune responses—the hypersensitive response in which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death and systemic acquired resistance where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogens presence.
2 Chloroplasts stimulate both responses by purposely damaging their photosynthetic system producing reactive oxygen species.
3 High levels of reactive oxygen species will cause the hypersensitive response.
4 The reactive oxygen species also directly kill any pathogens within the cell.
5 Lower levels of reactive oxygen species initiate systemic acquired resistance triggering defensemolecule production in the rest of the plant.
6 How many major immune responses do plants have?	two	1

10 What does damaging photosynthesis systems create?	reactive oxygen species	2
1 Chloroplasts can serve as cellular sensors.
2 After detecting stress in a cell which might be due to a pathogen chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid jasmonic acid nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defensesignals.
3 As cellular signals reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules so they probably dont leave the chloroplast but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule.
4 All these molecules initiate retrograde signaling—signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus.
5 What molecules act as defense signals?	salicylic acid  jasmonic acid  nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species	2

8 What is retrograde signaling?	signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus	4
1 One of the main functions of the chloroplast is its role in photosynthesis the process by which light is transformed into chemical energy to subsequently produce food in the form of sugars.
2 Water H2O and carbon dioxide CO2 are used in photosynthesis and sugar and oxygen O2 is made using light energy.
3 Photosynthesis is divided into two stages—the light reactions where water is split to produce oxygen and the dark reactions or Calvin cycle which builds sugar molecules from carbon dioxide.
4 The two phases are linked by the energy carriers adenosine triphosphate ATP and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate NADP.

1 Like mitochondria chloroplasts use the potential energy stored in an H or hydrogen ion gradient to generate ATP energy.
2 The two photosystems capture light energy to energize electrons taken from water and release them down an electron transport chain.
3 The molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space creating a concentration gradient with more hydrogen ions up to a thousand times as many inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma.
4 The hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space then diffuse back down their concentration gradient flowing back out into the stroma through ATP synthase.
5 ATP synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate or ATP.
6 Because chloroplast ATP synthase projects out into the stroma the ATP is synthesized there in position to be used in the dark reactions.

1 While photosystem II photolyzes water to obtain and energize new electrons photosystem I simply reenergizes depleted electrons at the end of an electron transport chain.
2 Normally the reenergized electrons are taken by NADP though sometimes they can flow back down more Hpumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more ATP.
3 This is termed cyclic photophosphorylation because the electrons are recycled.
4 Cyclic photophosphorylation is common in C4 plants which need more ATP than NADPH.

1 The Calvin cycle starts by using the enzyme Rubisco to fix CO2 into fivecarbon Ribulose bisphosphate RuBP molecules.
2 The result is unstable sixcarbon molecules that immediately break down into threecarbon molecules called 3phosphoglyceric acid or 3PGA.
3 The ATP and NADPH made in the light reactions is used to convert the 3PGA into glyceraldehyde3phosphate or G3P sugar molecules.
4 Most of the G3P molecules are recycled back into RuBP using energy from more ATP but one out of every six produced leaves the cycle—the end product of the dark reactions.

1 Alternatively glucose monomers in the chloroplast can be linked together to make starch which accumulates into the starch grains found in the chloroplast.
2 Under conditions such as high atmospheric CO2 concentrations these starch grains may grow very large distorting the grana and thylakoids.
3 The starch granules displace the thylakoids but leave them intact.
4 Waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast or more accurately the plant cell.
5 This depletes a plants free phosphate supply which indirectly stimulates chloroplast starch synthesis.
6 While linked to low photosynthesis rates the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency of photosynthesis and might simply be a side effect of another photosynthesisdepressing factor.

1 Photorespiration can occur when the oxygen concentration is too high.
2 Rubisco cannot distinguish between oxygen and carbon dioxide very well so it can accidentally add O2 instead of CO2 to RuBP.
3 This process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis—it consumes ATP and oxygen releases CO2 and produces no sugar.
4 It can waste up to half the carbon fixed by the Calvin cycle.
5 Several mechanisms have evolved in different lineages that raise the carbon dioxide concentration relative to oxygen within the chloroplast increasing the efficiency of photosynthesis.
6 These mechanisms are called carbon dioxide concentrating mechanisms or CCMs.
7 These include Crassulacean acid metabolism C4 carbon fixation and pyrenoids.
8 Chloroplasts in C4 plants are notable as they exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism.

1 Chloroplasts alone make almost all of a plant cells amino acids in their stroma except the sulfurcontaining ones like cysteine and methionine.
2 Cysteine is made in the chloroplast the proplastid too but it is also synthesized in the cytosol and mitochondria probably because it has trouble crossing membranes to get to where it is needed.
3 The chloroplast is known to make the precursors to methionine but it is unclear whether the organelle carries out the last leg of the pathway or if it happens in the cytosol.

1 Chloroplasts are a special type of a plant cell organelle called a plastid though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably.
2 There are many other types of plastids which carry out various functions.
3 All chloroplasts in a plant are descended from undifferentiated proplastids found in the zygote or fertilized egg.
4 Proplastids are commonly found in an adult plants apical meristems.
5 Chloroplasts do not normally develop from proplastids in root tip meristems—instead the formation of starchstoring amyloplasts is more common.

1 If angiosperm shoots are not exposed to the required light for chloroplast formation proplastids may develop into an etioplast stage before becoming chloroplasts.
2 An etioplast is a plastid that lacks chlorophyll and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma called a prolamellar body.
3 While etioplasts lack chlorophyll they have a yellow chlorophyll precursor stocked.
4 Within a few minutes of light exposure the prolamellar body begins to reorganize into stacks of thylakoids and chlorophyll starts to be produced.
5 This process where the etioplast becomes a chloroplast takes several hours.
6 Gymnosperms do not require light to form chloroplasts.

1 Plastid differentiation is not permanent in fact many interconversions are possible.
2 Chloroplasts may be converted to chromoplasts which are pigmentfilled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in flowers and ripe fruit.
3 Starch storing amyloplasts can also be converted to chromoplasts and it is possible for proplastids to develop straight into chromoplasts.
4 Chromoplasts and amyloplasts can also become chloroplasts like what happens when a carrot or a potato is illuminated.
5 If a plant is injured or something else causes a plant cell to revert to a meristematic state chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into proplastids.
6 Chloroplast amyloplast chromoplast proplast etc are not absolute states—intermediate forms are common.

1 The division process starts when the proteins FtsZ1 and FtsZ2 assemble into filaments and with the help of a protein ARC6 form a structure called a Zring within the chloroplasts stroma.
2 The Min system manages the placement of the Zring ensuring that the chloroplast is cleaved more or less evenly.
3 The protein MinD prevents FtsZ from linking up and forming filaments.
4 Another protein ARC3 may also be involved but it is not very well understood.
5 These proteins are active at the poles of the chloroplast preventing Zring formation there but near the center of the chloroplast MinE inhibits them allowing the Zring to form.

1 Next the two plastiddividing rings or PD rings form.
2 The inner plastiddividing ring is located in the inner side of the chloroplasts inner membrane and is formed first.
3 The outer plastiddividing ring is found wrapped around the outer chloroplast membrane.
4 It consists of filaments about 5 nanometers across arranged in rows 64 nanometers apart and shrinks to squeeze the chloroplast.
5 This is when chloroplast constriction beginsIn a few species like Cyanidioschyzon merolæ chloroplasts have a third plastiddividing ring located in the chloroplasts intermembrane space.

1 Light has been shown to be a requirement for chloroplast division.
2 Chloroplasts can grow and progress through some of the constriction stages under poor quality green light but are slow to complete division—they require exposure to bright white light to complete division.
3 Spinach leaves grown under green light have been observed to contain many large dumbbellshaped chloroplasts.

1 Recently chloroplasts have caught attention by developers of genetically modified crops.
2 Since in most flowering plants chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent transgenes in these plastids cannot be disseminated by pollen.
3 This makes plastid transformation a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained thus posing significantly lower environmental risks.
4 This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture.
5 While the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species recent results in tobacco plants are promising showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1000000.

1 A prime number or a prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2 A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number.
3 For example 5 is prime because 1 and 5 are its only positive integer factors whereas 6 is composite because it has the divisors 2 and 3 in addition to 1 and 6.
4 The fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering.
5 The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization eg 3 1 · 3 1 · 1 · 3 etc.

1 The property of being prime or not is called primality.
2 A simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division.
3 It consists of testing whether n is a multiple of any integer between 2 and .
4 Algorithms much more efficient than trial division have been devised to test the primality of large numbers.
5 These include the Miller–Rabin primality test which is fast but has a small probability of error and the AKS primality test which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical.

1 There are infinitely many primes as demonstrated by Euclid around 300 BC.
2 There is no known simple formula that separates prime numbers from composite numbers.
3 However the distribution of primes that is to say the statistical behaviour of primes in the large can be modelled.
4 The first result in that direction is the prime number theorem proven at the end of the 19th century which says that the probability that a given randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits or to the logarithm of n.

1 Many questions regarding prime numbers remain open such as Goldbachs conjecture that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes and the twin prime conjecture that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2.
2 Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers.
3 Primes are used in several routines in information technology such as publickey cryptography which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors.
4 Prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains mainly algebra such as prime elements and prime ideals.
5 What is the name of the supposition that any number larger than 2 can be represented as the sum of two primes?	Goldbachs conjecture	1

1 Hence 6 is not prime.
2 The image at the right illustrates that 12 is not prime 12  3 · 4.
3 No even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition any such number n has at least three distinct divisors namely 1 2 and n This implies that n is not prime.
4 Accordingly the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2.
5 Similarly when written in the usual decimal system all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1 3 7 or 9 since even numbers are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5.

1 Most early Greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number so they could not consider it to be a prime.
2 By the Middle Ages and Renaissance many mathematicians included 1 as the first prime number.
3 In the mid18th century Christian Goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with Leonhard Euler  who did not agree.
4 In the 19th century many mathematicians still considered the number 1 to be a prime.
5 For example Derrick Norman Lehmers list of primes up to 10006721 reprinted as late as 1956 started with 1 as its first prime.
6 Henri Lebesgue is said to be the last professional mathematician to call 1 prime.
7 By the early 20th century mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number but rather forms its own special category as a unit.

12 What type of number do modern mathematicians consider 1 to be?	its own special category as a unit	7
1 A large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime but Euclids fundamental theorem of arithmetic mentioned above would not hold as stated.
2 For example the number 15 can be factored as 3 · 5 and 1 · 3 · 5 if 1 were admitted as a prime these two presentations would be considered different factorizations of 15 into prime numbers so the statement of that theorem would have to be modified.
3 Similarly the sieve of Eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime a modified version of the sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 that is all other numbers and produce as output only the single number 1.
4 Furthermore the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of Eulers totient function or the sum of divisors function.
5 Which theorem would be invalid if the number 1 were considered prime?	Euclids fundamental theorem of arithmetic	1
6 The sieve of Eratosthenes would not be valid if what were true?	if 1 were considered a prime	3
7 What is another function that primes have that the number 1 does not?	Eulers totient function	4
8 What is one function that prime numbers have that 1 does not?	the sum of divisors function	4
9 If 1 were to be considered as prime what would the sieve of Eratosthenes yield for all other numbers?	only the single number 1	3
1 There are hints in the surviving records of the ancient Egyptians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers the Egyptian fraction expansions in the Rhind papyrus for instance have quite different forms for primes and for composites.
2 However the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the Ancient Greeks.
3 Euclids Elements circa 300 BC contain important theorems about primes including the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
4 Euclid also showed how to construct a perfect number from a Mersenne prime.

1 After the Greeks little happened with the study of prime numbers until the 17th century.
2 In 1640 Pierre de Fermat stated without proof Fermats little theorem later proved by Leibniz and Euler.
3 Fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n  1 are prime they are called Fermat numbers and he verified this up to n  4 or 216  1.
4 However the very next Fermat number 232  1 is composite one of its prime factors is 641 as Euler discovered later and in fact no further Fermat numbers are known to be prime.
5 The French monk Marin Mersenne looked at primes of the form 2p − 1 with p a prime.

11 To what extent did Fermat confirm the validity of Fermat numbers?	up to n  4 or 216  1	3
1 The most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division.
2 This routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n If the result of any of these divisions is an integer then n is not a prime otherwise it is a prime.
3 Indeed if  is composite with a and b ≠ 1 then one of the factors a or b is necessarily at most .
4 For example for  the trial divisions are by m  2 3 4 5 and 6.
5 None of these numbers divides 37 so 37 is prime.
6 This routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to  is known—then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime.
7 For example to check the primality of 37 only three divisions are necessary m  2 3 and 5 given that 4 and 6 are composite.
8 What is the most elemental way to test the primality of any integer n?	trial division	1
9 What makes the method of trial division more efficient?	if a complete list of primes up to  is known	6

1 Modern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes probabilistic or Monte Carlo and deterministic algorithms.
2 Deterministic algorithms provide a way to tell for sure whether a given number is prime or not.
3 For example trial division is a deterministic algorithm because if performed correctly it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite.
4 Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster but do not completely prove that a number is prime.
5 These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way.
6 For example a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number.
7 If we repeat the test n times and pass every time then the probability that our number is composite is 11pn which decreases exponentially with the number of tests so we can be as sure as we like though never perfectly sure that the number is prime.
8 On the other hand if the test ever fails then we know that the number is composite.
9 How many modern types of primality tests for general numbers n are there?	two main classes	1
10 What is the name of one type of modern primality test?	probabilistic or Monte Carlo	1
11 What is the name of another type of modern primality test?	deterministic	1
12 What type of algorithm is trial division?	deterministic	3
13 When using a probabilistic algorithm how is the probability that the number is composite expressed mathematically?	11pn	7
1 A particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the Fermat primality test which relies on the fact Fermats little theorem that np≡n mod p for any n if p is a prime number.
2 If we have a number b that we want to test for primality then we work out nb mod b for a random value of n as our test.
3 A flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers the Carmichael numbers that satisfy the Fermat identity even though they are not prime so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and Carmichael numbers.
4 Carmichael numbers are substantially rarer than prime numbers though so this test can be useful for practical purposes.
5 More powerful extensions of the Fermat primality test such as the BailliePSW MillerRabin and SolovayStrassen tests are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number.

1 The zeta function is closely related to prime numbers.
2 For example the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function if there were only finitely many primes then ζ1 would have a finite value.
3 However the harmonic series 1  12  13  14   diverges ie exceeds any given number so there must be infinitely many primes.

1 The unproven Riemann hypothesis dating from 1859 states that except for s  −2 −4  all zeroes of the ζfunction have real part equal to 12.
2 The connection to prime numbers is that it essentially says that the primes are as regularly distributed as possible.
3 clarification needed From a physical viewpoint it roughly states that the irregularity in the distribution of primes only comes from random noise.
4 From a mathematical viewpoint it roughly states that the asymptotic distribution of primes about xlog x of numbers less than x are primes the prime number theorem also holds for much shorter intervals of length about the square root of x for intervals near x.

4 As of February 2011update this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n  2 · 1017.
5 Weaker statements than this have been proven for example Vinogradovs theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes.
6 Chens theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime the product of two primes.

1 For a long time number theory in general and the study of prime numbers in particular was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics with no applications outside of the selfinterest of studying the topic with the exception of use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly.
2 In particular number theorists such as British mathematician G H Hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance.

1 The evolutionary strategy used by cicadas of the genus Magicicada make use of prime numbers.
2 These insects spend most of their lives as grubs underground.
3 They only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7 13 or 17 years at which point they fly about breed and then die after a few weeks at most.
4 The logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on Magicicadas.
5 If Magicicadas appeared at a nonprime number intervals say every 12 years then predators appearing every 2 3 4 6 or 12 years would be sure to meet them.
6 Over a 200year period average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14 and 15year cicadas would be up to 2 higher than during outbreaks of 13 and 17year cicadas.

1 The concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics.
2 Generally prime indicates minimality or indecomposability in an appropriate sense.
3 For example the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1.
4 It is either Q or the finite field with p elements whence the name.
5 Often a second additional meaning is intended by using the word prime namely that any object can be essentially uniquely decomposed into its prime components.
6 For example in knot theory a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots.
7 Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots.

1 Prime ideals are the points of algebrogeometric objects via the notion of the spectrum of a ring.
2 Arithmetic geometry also benefits from this notion and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory.
3 For example factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field a basic problem of algebraic number theory bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry.

1 In particular this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by p in sharp contrast to the usual absolute value also referred to as the infinite prime.
2 While completing Q roughly filling the gaps with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers completing with respect to the padic norm −p yields the field of padic numbers.
3 These are essentially all possible ways to complete Q by Ostrowskis theorem.
4 Certain arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed or local fields.

1 The flow of cold gray mountain water continues for some distance into the lake.
2 The cold water flows near the surface and at first doesnt mix with the warmer green waters of Upper Lake.
3 But then at the socalled Rheinbrech the Rhine water abruptly falls into the depths because of the greater density of cold water.
4 The flow reappears on the surface at the northern German shore of the lake off the island of Lindau.

1 Between Bingen and Bonn the Middle Rhine flows through the Rhine Gorge a formation which was created by erosion.
2 The rate of erosion equaled the uplift in the region such that the river was left at about its original level while the surrounding lands raised.
3 The gorge is quite deep and is the stretch of the river which is known for its many castles and vineyards.

1 Until the early 1980s industry was a major source of water pollution.
2 Although many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine up into Switzerland it is along the Lower Rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated as the river passes the major cities of Cologne Düsseldorf and Duisburg.
3 Duisburg is the home of Europes largest inland port and functions as a hub to the sea ports of Rotterdam Antwerp and Amsterdam.
4 The Ruhr which joins the Rhine in Duisburg is nowadays a clean river thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls a transition from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures such as the reforestation of Slag and brownfields.

1 From here the situation becomes more complicated as the Dutch name Rijn no longer coincides with the main flow of water.
2 Two thirds of the water flow volume of the Rhine flows farther west through the Waal and then via the Merwede and Nieuwe Merwede De Biesbosch merging with the Meuse through the Hollands Diep and Haringvliet estuaries into the North Sea.
3 The Beneden Merwede branches off near HardinxveldGiessendam and continues as the Noord to join the Lek near the village of Kinderdijk to form the Nieuwe Maas then flows past Rotterdam and continues via Het Scheur and the Nieuwe Waterweg to the North Sea.
4 The Oude Maas branches off near Dordrecht farther down rejoining the Nieuwe Maas to form Het Scheur.

1 The other third of the water flows through the Pannerdens Kanaal and redistributes in the IJssel and Nederrijn.
2 The IJssel branch carries one ninth of the water flow of the Rhine north into the IJsselmeer a former bay while the Nederrijn carries approximately two ninths of the flow west along a route parallel to the Waal.
3 However at Wijk bij Duurstede the Nederrijn changes its name and becomes the Lek.

1 The name Rijn from here on is used only for smaller streams farther to the north which together formed the main river Rhine in Roman times.
2 Though they retained the name these streams no longer carry water from the Rhine but are used for draining the surrounding land and polders.
3 From Wijk bij Duurstede the old north branch of the Rhine is called Kromme Rijn Bent Rhine past Utrecht first Leidse Rijn Rhine of Leiden and then Oude Rijn Old Rhine.
4 The latter flows west into a sluice at Katwijk where its waters can be discharged into the North Sea.
5 This branch once formed the line along which the Limes Germanicus were built.
6 During periods of lower sea levels within the various ice ages the Rhine took a left turn creating the Channel River the course of which now lies below the English Channel.

1 The RhineMeuse Delta the most important natural region of the Netherlands begins near Millingen aan de Rijn close to the DutchGerman border with the division of the Rhine into Waal and Nederrijn.
2 Since the Rhine contributes most of the water the shorter term Rhine Delta is commonly used.
3 However this name is also used for the river delta where the Rhine flows into Lake Constance so it is clearer to call the larger one RhineMeuse delta or even Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta as the Scheldt ends in the same delta.
4 What is the name of the Delta in the Netherlands?	RhineMeuse	1
5 Where does the Delta in the Netherlands begin?	Millingen aan de Rijn 	1
6 What is the nickname for the Delta in the Netherlands?	Rhine Delta	2
1 The shape of the Rhine delta is determined by two bifurcations first at Millingen aan de Rijn the Rhine splits into Waal and Pannerdens Kanaal which changes its name to Nederrijn at Angeren and second near Arnhem the IJssel branches off from the Nederrijn.
2 This creates three main flows two of which change names rather often.
3 The largest and southern main branch begins as Waal and continues as Boven Merwede Upper Merwede Beneden Merwede Lower Merwede Noord River North River Nieuwe Maas New Meuse Het Scheur the Rip and Nieuwe Waterweg New Waterway.
4 The middle flow begins as Nederrijn then changes into Lek then joins the Noord thereby forming Nieuwe Maas.
5 The northern flow keeps the name IJssel until it flows into Lake IJsselmeer.
6 Three more flows carry significant amounts of water the Nieuwe Merwede New Merwede which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Boven to Beneden Merwede the Oude Maas Old Meuse which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Beneden Merwede into Noord and Dordtse Kil which branches off from Oude Maas.
7 At Millingen aan de Rijn where the Rhine splits what does it change its name to?	Nederrijn at Angeren	1
8 How many main flows are branched off from the Nederrijn?	three	2
9 What is the largest main branch of the Rhine?	Waal	3
10 What is the translation of Oude Maas?	Old Meuse	6
11 What is the English translation of Het Scheur?	the Rip	3
1 Before the St Elizabeths flood 1421 the Meuse flowed just south of todays line MerwedeOude Maas to the North Sea and formed an archipelagolike estuary with Waal and Lek.
2 This system of numerous bays estuarylike extended rivers many islands and constant changes of the coastline is hard to imagine today.
3 From 1421 to 1904 the Meuse and Waal merged further upstream at Gorinchem to form Merwede.
4 For flood protection reasons the Meuse was separated from the Waal through a lock and diverted into a new outlet called Bergse Maas then Amer and then flows into the former bay Hollands Diep.
5 What flood impacted the Meuse?	St Elizabeths	1
6 What year did the flood that impacted the Meuse take place?	1421	1

1 The hydrography of the current delta is characterized by the deltas main arms disconnected arms Hollandse IJssel Linge Vecht etc.
2 and smaller rivers and streams.
3 Many rivers have been closed dammed and now serve as drainage channels for the numerous polders.
4 The construction of Delta Works changed the Delta in the second half of the 20th Century fundamentally.
5 Currently Rhine water runs into the sea or into former marine bays now separated from the sea in five places namely at the mouths of the Nieuwe Merwede Nieuwe Waterway Nieuwe Maas Dordtse Kil Spui and IJssel.
6 What do closed rivers serve as after they close?	drainage channels	3
7 What changed the Rhines Delta?	construction of Delta Works	4
8 What is the term for closing off rivers that are no longer connected?	dammed	3

1 The RhineMeuse Delta is a tidal delta shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers but also by tidal currents.
2 This meant that high tide formed a serious risk because strong tidal currents could tear huge areas of land into the sea.
3 Before the construction of the Delta Works tidal influence was palpable up to Nijmegen and even today after the regulatory action of the Delta Works the tide acts far inland.
4 At the Waal for example the most landward tidal influence can be detected between Brakel and Zaltbommel.
5 What type of Delta is the RhineMeuse?	tidal delta	1
6 Besides rivers what shapes the sedimentation of the rivers?	tidal currents	1
7 What does a high tide risk near lands?	tear huge areas of land into the sea	2

1 In southern Europe the stage was set in the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era with the opening of the Tethys Ocean between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates between about 240 MBP and 220 MBP million years before present.
2 The present Mediterranean Sea descends from this somewhat larger Tethys sea.
3 At about 180 MBP in the Jurassic Period the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods.
4 Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography Iberia pushed up the Pyrenees Italy the Alps and Anatolia moving west the mountains of Greece and the islands.
5 The compression and orogeny continue today as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes.
6 The present Mediterranean Sea descends from what sea?	Tethys sea	2
7 What period did plates reverse directions to compress the Tethys floor?	Jurassic Period	3
8 Microplates squeezing and rotating created the features of what?	Mediterranean geography	4
9 What period opened the Tethys Ocean?	Mesozoic Era	1
10 What pushed up the Pyrenees?	Iberia	4
1 From the Eocene onwards the ongoing Alpine orogeny caused a N–S rift system to develop in this zone.
2 The main elements of this rift are the Upper Rhine Graben in southwest Germany and eastern France and the Lower Rhine Embayment in northwest Germany and the southeastern Netherlands.
3 By the time of the Miocene a river system had developed in the Upper Rhine Graben that continued northward and is considered the first Rhine river.
4 At that time it did not yet carry discharge from the Alps instead the watersheds of the Rhone and Danube drained the northern flanks of the Alps.
5 What rift system developed in the Alpine orogeny?	N–S	1
6 What elements from the rift system in the Alpine orogeny in Southwest Germany?	Upper Rhine Graben	2
7 What time did a river system develop in the Upper Rhine Graben?	Miocene	3
8 The Rhine and what other river drained the northern flanks of the alps?	Danube	4
1 Through stream capture the Rhine extended its watershed southward.
2 By the Pliocene period the Rhine had captured streams down to the Vosges Mountains including the Mosel the Main and the Neckar.
3 The northern Alps were then drained by the Rhone.
4 By the early Pleistocene period the Rhine had captured most of its current Alpine watershed from the Rhône including the Aar.
5 Since that time the Rhine has added the watershed above Lake Constance Vorderrhein Hinterrhein Alpenrhein captured from the Rhône the upper reaches of the Main beyond Schweinfurt and the Vosges Mountains captured from the Meuse to its watershed.
6 How did the Rhine extend watershed southward?	stream capture	1
7 What period did the Rhine capture streams?	Pliocene period	2
8 Where are the streams the Rhine captured?	Vosges Mountains	2
1 Around 25 million years ago ending 11600 years ago was the geological period of the Ice Ages.
2 Since approximately 600000 years ago six major Ice Ages have occurred in which sea level dropped 120 m 390 ft and much of the continental margins became exposed.
3 In the Early Pleistocene the Rhine followed a course to the northwest through the present North Sea.
4 During the socalled Anglian glaciation 450000 yr BP marine oxygen isotope stage 12 the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed that overflowed through the English Channel.
5 This caused the Rhines course to be diverted through the English Channel.
6 Since then during glacial times the river mouth was located offshore of Brest France and rivers like the Thames and the Seine became tributaries to the Rhine.
7 During interglacials when sea level rose to approximately the present level the Rhine built deltas in what is now the Netherlands.
8 What period was 25 million years ago?	Ice Ages	1
9 How many major ice ages have occurred?	six	2
10 How far did the sea level drop in the ice ages?	120 m	2
11 In early Pleistocene what direction did the Rhine flow?	northwest	3
12 During glacial times where was the mouth of the Rhine located?	Brest	6
1 The last glacial ran from 74000 BP  Before Present until the end of the Pleistocene 11600 BP.
2 In northwest Europe it saw two very cold phases peaking around 70000 BP and around 29000–24000 BP.
3 The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum Last Glacial Maximum.
4 During this time the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest through the English Channel and finally to the Atlantic Ocean.
5 The English Channel the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea were dry land mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m 390 ft lower than today.
6 When did the last glacial start?	74 000 BP	1
7 When did the last glacial end?	11 600 BP	1
8 Which direction did the Rhine flow during the last cold phase?	west	4

10 Besides the North Sea and the Irish Channel what else was lowered in the last cold phase?	English Channel	5
1 Most of the Rhines current course was not under the ice during the last Ice Age although its source must still have been a glacier.
2 A tundra with Ice Age flora and fauna stretched across middle Europe from Asia to the Atlantic Ocean.
3 Such was the case during the Last Glacial Maximum ca.
4 22000–14000 yr BP when icesheets covered Scandinavia the Baltics Scotland and the Alps but left the space between as open tundra.
5 The loess or windblown dust over that tundra settled in and around the Rhine Valley contributing to its current agricultural usefulness.

10 What is the term for windblown dust in a tundra?	loess	5
1 As northwest Europe slowly began to warm up from 22000 years ago onward frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fallwinter snow covers melted in spring.
2 Much of the discharge was routed to the Rhine and its downstream extension.
3 Rapid warming and changes of vegetation to open forest began about 13000 BP.
4 By 9000 BP Europe was fully forested.
5 With globally shrinking icecover ocean water levels rose and the English Channel and North Sea reinundated.
6 Meltwater adding to the ocean and land subsidence drowned the former coasts of Europe transgressionally.
7 When did Europe slowly begin to warm up from the last Ice Age?	22 000 years ago	1
8 What did frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers begin to do?	thaw	1
9 Where did the discharge from glaciers go in Europe in the last Ice Age?	Rhine	2
10 When did rapid warming begin and help vegetation?	13 000 BP	3
11 When was Europe fully forested and recovered from the last Ice Age?	9000 BP	4
1 Since 7500 yr ago a situation with tides and currents very similar to present has existed.
2 Rates of sealevel rise had dropped so far that natural sedimentation by the Rhine and coastal processes together could compensate the transgression by the sea in the last 7000 years the coast line was roughly at the same location.
3 In the southern North Sea due to ongoing tectonic subsidence the sea level is still rising at the rate of about 1–3 cm 039–118 in per century 1 metre or 39 inches in last 3000 years.
4 When did tides and currents similar to our current system begin?	7500 yr ago	1

1 At the begin of the Holocene 11700 years ago the Rhine occupied its LateGlacial valley.
2 As a meandering river it reworked its iceage braidplain.
3 As sealevel continued to rise in the Netherlands the formation of the Holocene RhineMeuse delta began 8000 years ago.
4 Coeval absolute sealevel rise and tectonic subsidence have strongly influenced delta evolution.
5 Other factors of importance to the shape of the delta are the local tectonic activities of the Peel Boundary Fault the substrate and geomorphology as inherited from the Last Glacial and the coastalmarine dynamics such as barrier and tidal inlet formations.

9 What country did the Rhine continue to rise during the holocene?	Netherlands	3
1 Since 3000 yr BP  years Before Present human impact is seen in the delta.
2 As a result of increasing land clearance Bronze Age agriculture in the upland areas central Germany the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up.
3 This caused increased flooding and sedimentation ending peat formation in the delta.
4 The shifting of river channels to new locations on the floodplain termed avulsion was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta.
5 Over the past 6000 years approximately 80 avulsions have occurred.
6 Direct human impact in the delta started with peat mining for salt and fuel from Roman times onward.
7 This was followed by embankment of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries which took place in the 11–13th century AD.
8 Thereafter canals were dug bends were short cut and groynes were built to prevent the rivers channels from migrating or silting up.
9 When have humans started impacting the delta?	3000 yr BP	1
10 What has increased sediment and delta growth also produced in the Rhine?	increased flooding and sedimentation	3
11 What increased in the Rhine because of the land clearance in the upland areas?	sediment load	2

1 At present the branches Waal and NederrijnLek discharge to the North Sea through the former Meuse estuary near Rotterdam.
2 The river IJssel branch flows to the north and enters the IJsselmeer formerly the Zuider Zee brackish lagoon however since 1932 a freshwater lake.
3 The discharge of the Rhine is divided among three branches the River Waal 69 of total discharge the River Nederrijn – Lek 29 of total discharge and the River IJssel 19 of total discharge.
4 This discharge distribution has been maintained since 1709 by river engineering works including the digging of the Pannerdens canal and since the 20th century with the help of weirs in the Nederrijn river.

1 The Rhine was not known to Herodotus and first enters the historical period in the 1st century BC in Romanera geography.
2 At that time it formed the boundary between Gaul and Germania.
3 The Upper Rhine had been part of the areal of the late Hallstatt culture since the 6th century BC and by the 1st century BC the areal of the La Tène culture covered almost its entire length forming a contact zone with the Jastorf culture ie.
4 the locus of early CelticGermanic cultural contact.
5 In Roman geography the Rhine formed the boundary between Gallia and Germania by definition eg.
6 Maurus Servius Honoratus Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil 8727 Rhenus fluvius Galliae qui Germanos a Gallia dividit The Rhine is a river of Gaul which divides the Germanic people from Gaul.
7 When was the Rhine first discovered?	1st century BC	1

1 From the death of Augustus in AD 14 until after AD 70 Rome accepted as her Germanic frontier the waterboundary of the Rhine and upper Danube.
2 Beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum Mainz the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridgeheads.
3 The northern section of this frontier where the Rhine is deep and broad remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell.
4 The southern part was different.
5 The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed.
6 The frontier which they form is inconveniently long enclosing an acuteangled wedge of foreign territory between the modern Baden and Württemberg.
7 The Germanic populations of these lands seem in Roman times to have been scanty and Roman subjects from the modern AlsaceLorraine had drifted across the river eastwards.
8 When did Augustus die?	AD 14	1
9 The Rhine and what other river were accepted as the Germanic frontier?	Danube	1

1 The Romans kept eight legions in five bases along the Rhine.
2 The actual number of legions present at any base or in all depended on whether a state or threat of war existed.

1 At the end of World War I the Rhineland was subject to the Treaty of Versailles.
2 This decreed that it would be occupied by the allies until 1935 and after that it would be a demilitarised zone with the German army forbidden to enter.
3 The Treaty of Versailles and this particular provision in general caused much resentment in Germany and is often cited as helping Adolf Hitlers rise to power.
4 The allies left the Rhineland in 1930 and the German army reoccupied it in 1936 which was enormously popular in Germany.

1 For the next three hundred years Scotland was directly governed by the Parliament of Great Britain and the subsequent Parliament of the United Kingdom both seated at Westminster and the lack of a Parliament of Scotland remained an important element in Scottish national identity.
2 Suggestions for a devolved Parliament were made before 1914 but were shelved due to the outbreak of the First World War.
3 A sharp rise in nationalism in Scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence and in 1969 prompted the incumbent Labour government of Harold Wilson to set up the Kilbrandon Commission to consider the British constitution.
4 One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more selfgovernment for Scotland within the unitary state of the United Kingdom.

3 Any member can put their name forward to be First Minister and a vote is taken by all members of Parliament.
4 Normally the leader of the largest party is returned as First Minister and head of the Scottish Government.
5 Theoretically Parliament also elects the Scottish Ministers who form the government of Scotland and sit in the Scottish cabinet but such ministers are in practice appointed to their roles by the First Minister.
6 Junior ministers who do not attend cabinet are also appointed to assist Scottish ministers in their departments.
7 Most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected MSPs with the exception of Scotlands Chief Law Officers the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General.

1 Of the 129 MSPs 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as Constituency MSPs.
2 Voters choose one member to represent the constituency and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency MSP.
3 The 73 Scottish Parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the UK Parliament constituencies in Scotland prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of Scottish MPs with the exception of Orkney and Shetland which each return their own constituency MSP.
4 Currently the average Scottish Parliament constituency comprises 55000 electors.
5 Given the geographical distribution of population in Scotland this results in constituencies of a smaller area in the Central Lowlands where the bulk of Scotlands population live and much larger constituency areas in the north and west of the country which have a low population density.
6 The island archipelagos of Orkney Shetland and the Western Isles comprise a much smaller number of electors due to their dispersed population and distance from the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.
7 If a Constituency MSP resigns from Parliament this triggers a byelection in his or her constituency where a replacement MSP is returned from one of the parties by the plurality system.
8 What is the number of Constituency MSPs?	73	1
9 When was there a reduction in the number of Scottish MPs?	2005	3

1 The total number of seats in the Parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the dHondt method.
2 For example to determine who is awarded the first list seat the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of seats the party won in the region at this point just constituency seats.
3 The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat.
4 This is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated.
5 How are the total numbers of seats allocated to parties?	proportionally to the number of votes received	1

1 Another major division within Islamism is between what Graham E Fuller has described as the fundamentalist guardians of the tradition Salafis such as those in the Wahhabi movement and the vanguard of change and Islamic reform centered around the Muslim Brotherhood.
2 Olivier Roy argues that Sunni panIslamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century when the Muslim Brotherhood movement and its focus on Islamisation of panArabism was eclipsed by the Salafi movement with its emphasis on sharia rather than the building of Islamic institutions and rejection of Shia Islam.
3 Following the Arab Spring Roy has described Islamism as increasingly interdependent with democracy in much of the Arab Muslim world such that neither can now survive without the other.
4 While Islamist political culture itself may not be democratic Islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy.
5 At the same time their popularity is such that no government can call itself democratic that excludes mainstream Islamist groups.

1 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat – whose policies included opening Egypt to Western investment infitah transferring Egypts allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States and making peace with Israel – released Islamists from prison and welcomed home exiles in tacit exchange for political support in his struggle against leftists.
2 His encouraging of the emergence of the Islamist movement was said to have been imitated by many other Muslim leaders in the years that followed.
3 This gentlemens agreement between Sadat and Islamists broke down in 1975 but not before Islamists came to completely dominate university student unions.

1 The interpretation of Islam promoted by this funding was the strict conservative Saudibased Wahhabism or Salafism.
2 In its harshest form it preached that Muslims should not only always oppose infidels in every way but hate them for their religion  for Allahs sake that democracy is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century that Shia and other nonWahhabi Muslims were infidels etc.
3 While this effort has by no means converted all or even most Muslims to the Wahhabist interpretation of Islam it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations and has set the Saudiinterpretation of Islam as the gold standard of religion in minds of some or many Muslims.

3 Imperialism is a policy of extending a countrys power and influence through colonization use of military force or other means.
4 Imperialism has greatly shaped the contemporary world.
5 It has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas.
6 The term imperialism has been applied to Western and Japanese political and economic dominance especially in Asia and Africa in the 19th and 20th centuries.
7 Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars.
8 Some writers such as Edward Said use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organised with an imperial center and a periphery.
9 The word imperialism has its origins in which ancient language?	Latin	2
10 By what means is imperialism usually administered?	military force	3
11 The term imperialism has been applied to western countries and which eastern county?	Japan	6
12 Imperialism is responsible for the rapid spread of what?	technologies and ideas	5
1 Imperialism is defined as A policy of extending a country’s power and influence through diplomacy or military force.
2 Imperialism is particularly focused on the control that one group often a state power has on another group of people.
3 This is often through various forms of othering see other based on racial religious or cultural stereotypes.
4 There are formal or informal imperialisms.
5 Formal imperialism is defined as physical control or fullfledged colonial rule.
6 Informal imperialism is less direct however it is still a powerful form of dominance.

8 colonial rule would be considered what type of imperialism?	Formal imperialism	5
9 imperialism often divides countries by using which technique?	othering	3
10 Informal imperialism is still dominant however less what?	direct	6
1 The definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers or simply generalpurpose aggressiveness.
2 Further on some writerswho.
3 used the term imperialism in slightly more discriminating fashion to mean all kinds of domination or control by a group of people over another.
4 To clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of formal and informal imperialism the first meaning physical control or fullfledged colonial rule while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance.
5 Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally.
6 This is because with informal rule the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority enforcing land officials into large debts that cannot be repaid ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully.
7 A forced trade agreement between two countries would be an example of what?	informal imperialism	4
8 colonial rule or physical occupation of a territory is an example of what kind of imperialism?	formal	4
9 Some have generalized the meaning of the word imperialism down to generalpurpose what?	aggressiveness	1

1 The word ‘empire’ comes from the Latin word imperium for which the closest modern English equivalent would perhaps be ‘sovereignty’ or simply ‘rule’.
2 The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded.
3 Political power grew from conquering land however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes.
4 A distinction about empires is that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea.
5 Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products.
6 European empires in Asia and Africa have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires.
7 European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory.
8 The two main regions are the core and the periphery.
9 The core consists of high areas of income and profit the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit.
10 These critical theories of Geopolitics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern postcolonial world.
11 The Russian leader Lenin suggested that imperialism was the highest form of capitalism claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism.
12 This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era.
13 Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.
14 The amount of land a country controls is its greatest what?	distinction	2
15 Western Imperialism divided the globe according to which theory?	the world systems theory	7
16 Who suggested that imperialism was the highest form of capitalism?	Lenin	11
17 One countrys authority over a number of others would constitute the original country as what?	empires	13
18 Most imperialism was carried out using which method of transport?	seaborne	6
1 The term imperialism is often conflated with colonialism however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition.
2 Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe ones superiority domination and influence upon a person or group of people.
3 Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions.
4 Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power.
5 Particularly Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating imperialism involved the practice the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory while colonialism refers to the implanting of settlements on a distant territory.
6 Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.
7 116 Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism as it lacks a political focus.
8 further explanation needed.

10 What does colonialism lack that imperialism has?	political focus	7

1 Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two.
2 Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance either formally or informally.
3 Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism.
4 Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled.
5 Colonialisms core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war.
6 The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire by conquering the other states lands and therefore increasing its own dominance.
7 Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region.
8 Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure physical structure and economics of an area it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations.
9 Political advantage is an attribute of which state policies?	Imperialism and colonialism	1
10 Colonialism often means a country doing what?	taking physical control of another	2
11 How would one create an empire by means of Imperialism?	conquering the other states lands	6
12 What is colonialisms core meaning?	exploitation	5
13 what do conquering people pass down to native populations?	characteristics	8
1 A controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empirebuilding based on seemingly rational grounds.
2 J.
3 A Hobson identifies this justification on general grounds as It is desirable that the earth should be peopled governed and developed as far as possible by the races which can do this work best ie.
4 by the races of highest social efficiency.
5 Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons.
6 Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive imperialism was needed.
7 Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism.
8 The purportedly scientific nature of Social Darwinism and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism.
9 The rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose for example throughout Latin America whiteness is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento whitening are common.

1 The Royal Geographical Society of London and other geographical societies in Europe had great influence and were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries.
2 These societies also served as a space for travellers to share these storiesPolitical geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel of Germany and Halford Mackinder of Britain also supported imperialism.
3 Ratzel believed expansion was necessary for a state’s survival while Mackinder supported Britain’s imperial expansion these two arguments dominated the discipline for decades.

1 Geographical theories such as environmental determinism also suggested that tropical environments created uncivilized people in need of European guidance.
2 For instance American geographer Ellen Churchill Semple argued that even though human beings originated in the tropics they were only able to become fully human in the temperate zone.
3 Tropicality can be paralleled with Edward Said’s Orientalism as the west’s construction of the east as the “other”.
4 According to Siad orientalism allowed Europe to establish itself as the superior and the norm which justified its dominance over the essentialized Orient.
5 Which theory suggested people in the tropics were uncivilized?	environmental determinism	1
6 According to Ellen Churchill Semple what type of climate was necessary for humans to become fully human?	temperate	2
7 Which book by Edward Said portrayed the east as being the others?	Orientalism	3
8 According to certain Geographical theories what type of human does a tropical climate produce?	uncivilized	1
9 By justification certain racial and geographical theories Europe thought of itself as what?	superior	4
1 The principles of imperialism are often generalizable to the policies and practices of the British Empire during the last generation and proceeds rather by diagnosis than by historical description.
2 British imperialism often used the concept of Terra nullius Latin expression which stems from Roman law meaning empty land.
3 The country of Australia serves as a case study in relation to British settlement and colonial rule of the continent in the eighteenth century as it was premised on terra nullius and its settlers considered it unused by its sparse Aboriginal inhabitants.
4 What law justified British imperialism?	Terra nullius	2
5 When did Great Britain colonize Australia?	the eighteenth century	3
6 Imperialism is most often associated with which sovereignty?	the British Empire	1
7 What were the native inhabitants of Australia called?	Aboriginal	3
8 Terra Nullius is a Latin expression meaning what in English?	empty land	2
1 Orientalism as theorized by Edward Said refers to how the West developed an imaginative geography of the East.
2 This imaginative geography relies on an essentializing discourse that represents neither the diversity nor the social reality of the East.
3 Rather by essentializing the East this discourse uses the idea of placebased identities to create difference and distance between we the West and them the East or here in the West and there in the East.
4 This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient that positioned the East as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive West.
5 Defining the East as a negative vision of itself as its inferior not only increased the West’s sense of self but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so that it could be dominated and controlled.
6 The discourse of Orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social cultural political and economic control of other territories.
7 Orientalism refers to how the West developed a what of the East?	an imaginative geography	1
8 Early Western texts referencing the East describe the people as being what?	irrational and backward	4
9 The West saw the East as what?	inferior	5
10 What was used by the West to justify control over eastern territories?	Orientalism	6
11 The West saw themselves as what compared to the east?	progressive	4
1 To better illustrate this idea Bassett focuses his analysis of the role of nineteenthcentury maps during the scramble for Africa.
2 He states that maps contributed to empire by promoting assisting and legitimizing the extension of French and British power into West Africa.
3 During his analysis of nineteenthcentury cartographic techniques he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory.
4 This provided incentives for imperial and colonial powers to obtain information to fill in blank spaces on contemporary maps.

1 Cultural imperialism is when a countrys influence is felt in social and cultural circles ie.
2 its soft power such that it changes the moral cultural and societal worldview of another.
3 This is more than just foreign music television or film becoming popular with young people but that popular culture changing their own expectations of life and their desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted.
4 For example depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera Dallas during the Cold War changed the expectations of Romanians a more recent example is the influence of smuggled South Korean drama series in North Korea.
5 The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc.
6 Nor is such a usage of culture recent as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle with the aim that they would then become willing participants.

1 The Age of Imperialism a time period beginning around 1700 saw generally European industrializing nations engaging in the process of colonizing influencing and annexing other parts of the world in order to gain political power.
2 citation needed Although imperialist practices have existed for thousands of years the term Age of Imperialism generally refers to the activities of European powers from the early 18th century through to the middle of the 20th century for example the The Great Game in Persian lands the Scramble for Africa and the Open Door Policy in China.

1 During the 20th century historians John Gallagher 1919–1980 and Ronald Robinson 1920–1999 constructed a framework for understanding European imperialism.
2 They claim that European imperialism was influential and Europeans rejected the notion that imperialism required formal legal control by one government over another country.
3 In their view historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red.
4 The bulk of British emigration trade and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire.
5 Key to their thinking is the idea of empire informally if possible and formally if necessary.
6 attribution needed Because of the resources made available by imperialism the worlds economy grew significantly and became much more interconnected in the decades before World War I making the many imperial powers rich and prosperous.
7 When was John Gallagher born?	1919	1
8 When did Ronald Robinson die?	1999	1
9 What profession were Ronald Robinson and John Gallagher?	historians	1
10 What grew on a global scale as a result of imperialism?	the worlds economy	6
11 Who was made rich and prosperous prior to World War 1	many imperial powers 	6.
1 Europes expansion into territorial imperialism was largely focused on economic growth by collecting resources from colonies in combination with assuming political control by military and political means.
2 The colonization of India in the mid18th century offers an example of this focus there the British exploited the political weakness of the Mughal state and while military activity was important at various times the economic and administrative incorporation of local elites was also of crucial significance for the establishment of control over the subcontinents resources markets and manpower.
3 Although a substantial number of colonies had been designed to provide economic profit and to ship resources to home ports in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Fieldhouse suggests that in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in places such as Africa and Asia this idea is not necessarily valid.
4 European imperialism was focused on what?	economic growth	1
5 When did the colonization of India occur?	mid18th century	2
6 What did European empires rely on to supply them with resources?	colonies	1
7 Who did Britain exploit in India?	the Mughal state	2
1 Along with advancements in communication Europe also continued to advance in military technology.
2 European chemists made deadly explosives that could be used in combat and with innovations in machinery they were able to manufacture improved firearms.
3 By the 1880s the machine gun had become an effective battlefield weapon.
4 This technology gave European armies an advantage over their opponents as armies in lessdeveloped countries were still fighting with arrows swords and leather shields eg.
5 the Zulus in Southern Africa during the AngloZulu War of 1879.
6 What advancements besides military technology did Europe achieve?	communication	1
7 What did European chemists make that could be used in warfare?	deadly explosives	2

1 In anglophone academic works theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience.
2 The term Imperialism was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.
3 It was shortly appropriated by supporters of imperialism such as Joseph Chamberlain.
4 For some imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy others alleged that it was characterized by political selfinterest and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed.
5 Liberal John A Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term.
6 Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism.
7 In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion.
8 This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians.
9 Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of imperialism.
10 Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century but a world system extending over a period of centuries often going back to Christopher Columbus and in some accounts to the Crusades.
11 As the application of the term has expanded its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes the moral the economic the systemic the cultural and the temporal.
12 Those changes reflect  among other shifts in sensibility  a growing unease even squeamishness with the fact of power specifically Western power.
13 Theories on imperialism use which country as a model?	British	1
14 When did the term imperialism first come to be used by its current definition?	in the late 1870s	2
15 What was the idealized value of imperialism?	philanthropy	4
16 According to Lenin why must capitalistic countries have an imperialistic policy?	to constantly expand investment	7
1 The correlation between capitalism aristocracy and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists.
2 Much of the debate was pioneered by such theorists as J.
3 A Hobson 1858–1940 Joseph Schumpeter 1883–1950 Thorstein Veblen 1857–1929 and Norman Angell 1872–1967.
4 While these nonMarxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I they remained active in the interwar years.
5 Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and its impact on Europe as well as contributed to reflections on the rise of the militarypolitical complex in the United States from the 1950s.
6 Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation.
7 Hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption create wealth and encourage a peaceful tolerant multipolar world order.
8 some debate that there is a correlation between capitalism imperialism and what?	aristocracy	1
9 When was the militarypolitical complex reflected upon within the scope of understanding imperialism?	the 1950s	5

1 The concept environmental determinism served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples.
2 It was believed that a certain persons behaviours were determined by the environment in which they lived and thus validated their domination.
3 For example people living in tropical environments were seen as less civilized therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission.
4 Across the three waves of European colonialism first in the Americas second in Asia and lastly in Africa environmental determinism was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy.
5 This takes two forms orientalism and tropicality.
6 What served as a justification for imposing imperialistic policies on certain peoples or regions?	environmental determinism	1
7 What was thought to decide a persons behavior?	the environment in which they lived	2
8 Humans in tropical environments were considered what?	less civilized	3
9 Europe first colonized the Americas then Asia but what continent was third?	Africa	4

1 According to geographic scholars under colonizing empires the world could be split into climatic zones.
2 These scholars believed that Northern Europe and the MidAtlantic temperate climate produced a hardworking moral and upstanding human being.
3 Alternatively tropical climates yielded lazy attitudes sexual promiscuity exotic culture and moral degeneracy.
4 The people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from the European empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure they were seen as incapable of such a feat.
5 Similarly orientalism is a view of a people based on their geographical location.
6 Who thought the world could be split into climatic zones?	geographic scholars	1

1 Britains imperialist ambitions can be seen as early as the sixteenth century.
2 In 1599 the British East India Company was established and was chartered by Queen Elizabeth in the following year.
3 With the establishment of trading posts in India the British were able to maintain strength relative to others empires such as the Portuguese who already had set up trading posts in India.
4 In 1767 political activity caused exploitation of the East India Company causing the plundering of the local economy almost bringing the company into bankruptcy.

2 Republicans at first hostile to empire only became supportive when Germany started to build her own colonial empire.
3 As it developed the new empire took on roles of trade with France supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading French civilization and language as well as Catholicism.

1 It became a moral justification to lift the world up to French standards by bringing Christianity and French culture.
2 In 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism Jules Ferry declared France had a civilising mission The higher races have a right over the lower races they have a duty to civilize the inferior.
3 Full citizenship rights – ‘’assimilation’’ – were offered although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon.
4 Contrasting from Britain France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies with the only notable exception of Algeria where French settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority.

2 However after 1945 anticolonial movements began to challenge the Empire.
3 France fought and lost a bitter war in Vietnam in the 1950s.
4 Whereas they won the war in Algeria the French leader at the time Charles de Gaulle decided to grant Algeria independence anyway in 1962.
5 Its settlers and many local supporters relocated to France.

1 From their original homelands in Scandinavia and northern Europe Germanic tribes expanded throughout northern and western Europe in the middle period of classical antiquity southern Europe in late antiquity conquering Celtic and other peoples and by 800 CE forming the Holy Roman Empire the first German Empire.
2 However there was no real systemic continuity from the Western Roman Empire to its German successor which was famously described as not holy not Roman and not an empire as a great number of small states and principalities existed in the loosely autonomous confederation.
3 Although by 1000 CE the Germanic conquest of central western and southern Europe west of and including Italy was complete excluding only Muslim Iberia.
4 There was however little cultural integration or national identity and Germany remained largely a conceptual term referring to an amorphous area of central Europe.

9 Germany referred to which area more so than an actual country?	central Europe	4
1 Not a maritime power and not a nationstate as it would eventually become Germany’s participation in Western imperialism was negligible until the late 19th century.
2 The participation of Austria was primarily as a result of Habsburg control of the First Empire the Spanish throne and other royal houses.
3 further explanation needed After the defeat of Napoleon who caused the dissolution of that Holy Roman Empire Prussia and the German states continued to stand aloof from imperialism preferring to manipulate the European system through the Concert of Europe.
4 After Prussia unified the other states into the second German Empire after the FrancoGerman War its longtime Chancellor Otto von Bismarck 1862–90 long opposed colonial acquisitions arguing that the burden of obtaining maintaining and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefits.
5 He felt that colonies did not pay for themselves that the German bureaucratic system would not work well in the tropics and the diplomatic disputes over colonies would distract Germany from its central interest Europe itself.

10 What was Germanys central interest?	Europe	5
1 However in 1883–84 Germany began to build a colonial empire in Africa and the South Pacific before losing interest in imperialism.
2 Historians have debated exactly why Germany made this sudden and shortlived move.
3 verification needed Bismarck was aware that public opinion had started to demand colonies for reasons of German prestige.
4 He was influenced by Hamburg merchants and traders his neighbors at Friedrichsruh.
5 The establishment of the German colonial empire proceeded smoothly starting with German New Guinea in 1884.

1 Bolshevik leaders had effectively reestablished a polity with roughly the same extent as that empire by 1921 however with an internationalist ideology Lenin in particular asserted the right to limited selfdetermination for national minorities within the new territory.
2 Beginning in 1923 the policy of Indigenization korenizatsiia was intended to support nonRussians develop their national cultures within a socialist framework.
3 Never formally revoked it stopped being implemented after 1932.
4 After World War II the Soviet Union installed socialist regimes modeled on those it had installed in 1919–20 in the old Tsarist Empire in areas its forces occupied in Eastern Europe.
5 The Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China supported post–World War II communist movements in foreign nations and colonies to advance their own interests but were not always successful.

1 Trotsky and others believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution.
2 Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism.
3 However after Lenins death Joseph Stalin established socialism in one country for the Soviet Union creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements.
4 The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War.
5 With the beginning of the new era the after Stalin period called the thaw in the late 1950s the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the SovietAmerican relations starting a new wave of antiimperialist propaganda.
6 In his speech on the UN conference in 1960 he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders.
7 Although the Soviet Union declared itself antiimperialist critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires.
8 Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states.
9 It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control.
10 Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade.
11 Moreover the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government.
12 Non Russian Marxists within the Russian Federation and later the USSR like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism.

1 The First British Empire was based on mercantilism and involved colonies and holdings primarily in North America the Caribbean and India.
2 Its growth was reversed by the loss of the American colonies in 1776.
3 Britain made compensating gains in India Australia and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of trade and finance in Latin America after the independence of Spanish and Portuguese colonies about 1820.
4 By the 1840s Britain had adopted a highly successful policy of free trade that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world.
5 After losing its first Empire to the Americans Britain then turned its attention towards Asia Africa and the Pacific.
6 Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815 Britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe.
7 Increasing degrees of internal autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies in the 20th century.

1 A resurgence came in the late 19th century with the Scramble for Africa and major additions in Asia and the Middle East.
2 The British spirit of imperialism was expressed by Joseph Chamberlain and Lord Rosebury and implemented in Africa by Cecil Rhodes.
3 The pseudosciences of Social Darwinism and theories of race formed an ideological underpinning during this time.
4 Other influential spokesmen included Lord Cromer Lord Curzon General Kitchner Lord Milner and the writer Rudyard Kipling.

3 They were often backed by military force but were more often affected from behind the scenes.
4 This is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires.
5 In 1898 Americans who opposed imperialism created the AntiImperialist League to oppose the US annexation of the Philippines and Cuba.
6 One year later a war erupted in the Philippines causing business labor and government leaders in the US to condemn Americas occupation in the Philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many Filipinos.

1 Some have described the internal strife between various people groups as a form of imperialism or colonialism.
2 This internal form is distinct from informal US imperialism in the form of political and financial hegemony.
3 This internal form of imperialism is also distinct from the United States formation of colonies abroad.
4 Through the treatment of its indigenous peoples during westward expansion the United States took on the form of an imperial power prior to any attempts at external imperialism.
5 This internal form of empire has been referred to as internal colonialism.
6 Participation in the African slave trade and the subsequent treatment of its 12 to 15 million Africans is viewed by some to be a more modern extension of Americas internal colonialism.
7 However this internal colonialism faced resistance as external colonialism did but the anticolonial presence was far less prominent due to the nearly complete dominance that the United States was able to assert over both indigenous peoples and AfricanAmericans.
8 In his lecture on April 16 2003 Edward Said made a bold statement on modern imperialism in the United States whom he described as using aggressive means of attack towards the contemporary Orient due to their backward living lack of democracy and the violation of women’s rights.
9 The western world forgets during this process of converting the other that enlightenment and democracy are concepts that not all will agree upon.
10 Some people describe what between individuals or groups as imperialism or colonialism?	internal strife	1
11 the US expansion Westward could be viewed as what type of colonialism?	internal colonialism	5
12 How many Africans were brought into the United States during the slave trade?	12 to 15 million	6

1 Some argue that The United Methodist Church can lay a claim on apostolic succession as understood in the traditional sense.
2 As a result of the American Revolution John Wesley was compelled in 1784 to break with standard practice and ordain two of his lay preachers as presbyters Thomas Vasey and Richard Whatcoat.
3 Dr Thomas Coke already an Anglican priest assisted Wesley in this action.
4 Coke was then set apart as a superintendent bishop by Wesley and dispatched with Vasey and Whatcoat to America to take charge of Methodist activities there.
5 In defense of his action to ordain Wesley himself cited an ancient opinion from the Church of Alexandria which held that bishops and presbyters constituted one order and therefore bishops are to be elected from and by the presbyterate.
6 He knew that for two centuries the succession of bishops in the Church of Alexandria was preserved through ordination by presbyters alone and was considered valid by the ancient church.
7 Methodists today who would argue for apostolic succession would do so on these grounds.

2 Sanctifying grace enables us to respond to God by leading a Spiritfilled and Christlike life aimed toward love.
3 Wesley never claimed this state of perfection for himself but instead insisted the attainment of perfection was possible for all Christians.

1 Wesleyan theology stands at a unique crossroads between evangelical and sacramental between liturgical and charismatic and between AngloCatholic and Reformed theology and practice.
2 It has been characterized as Arminian theology with an emphasis on the work of the Holy Spirit to bring holiness into the life of the participating believer.
3 The United Methodist Church believes in prima scriptura seeing the Holy Bible as the primary authority in the Church and using sacred tradition reason and experience to interpret it with the aid of the Holy Spirit see Wesleyan Quadrilateral.
4 Therefore according to The Book of Discipline United Methodist theology is at once catholic evangelical and reformed.
5 Today the UMC is generally considered one of the more moderate and tolerant denominations with respect to race gender and ideology though the denomination itself actually includes a very wide spectrum of attitudes.
6 Comparatively the UMC stands to the right of liberal and progressive Protestant groups such as the United Church of Christ and the Episcopal Church on certain issues especially regarding sexuality but to the left of historically conservative evangelical traditions such as the Southern Baptists and Pentecostalism in regard to theological matters such as social justice and Biblical interpretation.
7 However it should be noted that the UMC is made up of a broad diversity of thought and so there are many clergy and laity within the UMC that hold differing viewpoints on such theological matters.

3 The denomination as a whole is committed to assisting the ministry of crisis pregnancy centers and pregnancy resource centers that compassionately help women find feasible alternatives to abortion.
4 Still the denomination is prochoice and also was a founding member of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choiceand 2008 General Conference went on record in support of the work of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice.

3 As such two official bodies of the United Methodist Church are part of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choices governing coalition The General Board of Church and Society and the United Methodist Women.
4 The church cautions that Governmental laws and regulations do not provide all the guidance required by the informed Christian conscience.
5 The Church emphasizes the need to be in supportive ministry with all women regardless of their choice.

1 Historically the Methodist Church has supported the temperance movement.
2 John Wesley warned against the dangers of drinking in his famous sermon The Use of Money and in his letter to an alcoholic.
3 At one time Methodist ministers had to take a pledge not to drink and encouraged their congregations to do the same.
4 Today the United Methodist Church states that it affirms our longstanding support of abstinence from alcohol as a faithful witness to Gods liberating and redeeming love for persons.
5 In fact the United Methodist Church uses unfermented grape juice in the sacrament of Holy Communion thus expressing pastoral concern for recovering alcoholics enabling the participation of children and youth and supporting the churchs witness of abstinence.

5 Other ministers have been defrocked for officiating at samesex weddings and several trials of others are scheduled.
6 Still some congregations have sought other ways to recognize samesex couples.
7 For example one congregation hosted a proposal for a samesex couple announcing their engagement.
8 Moreover some churches especially in 2016 after samesex marriage was legalized nationwide have provided blessings for samesex marriages.

1 In 1987 a United Methodist church court in New Hampshire defrocked Methodist minister Rose Mary Denman for openly living with a samesex partner.
2 In 2005 clergy credentials were removed from Irene Elizabeth Stroud after she was convicted in a church trial of violating church law by engaging in a lesbian relationship this conviction was later upheld by the Judicial Council the highest court in the denomination.
3 The Judicial Council also affirmed that a Virginia pastor had the right to deny local church membership to a man in an openly gay relationship.
4 This affirmation however was based upon a senior pastors right to judge the readiness of a congregant to join as a full member of the church.
5 However at the same time the UMC Judicial Council in 2008 ruled that conferences can determine their own policy related to transgender pastors and therefore some regional conferences have voted to recognize ordained transgender pastors.

1 The United Methodist Church opposes conscription as incompatible with the teaching of Scripture.
2 Therefore the Church supports and extends its ministry to those persons who conscientiously oppose all war or any particular war and who therefore refuse to serve in the armed forces or to cooperate with systems of military conscription.
3 However the United Methodist Church also supports and extends its ministry to those persons who conscientiously choose to serve in the armed forces or to accept alternative service.
4 The church also states that as Christians they are aware that neither the way of military action nor the way of inaction is always righteous before God.
5 What does the UMC oppose as incompatible with the teaching of Scripture?	conscription	1
6 The church states that as Christians they are aware that neither the way of what is righteous before God?	the way of military action	4
7 The Church supports those persons who conscientiously oppose what?	all war	2
1 The United Methodist Church maintains that war is incompatible with Christs message and teachings.
2 Therefore the Church rejects war as an instrument of national foreign policy to be employed only as a last resort in the prevention of such evils as genocide brutal suppression of human rights and unprovoked international aggression.

1 The conflict is known by multiple names.
2 In British America wars were often named after the sitting British monarch such as King Williams War or Queen Annes War.
3 As there had already been a King Georges War in the 1740s British colonists named the second war in King Georges reign after their opponents and it became known as the French and Indian War.
4 This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict and that this was part of the Seven Years War a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain.

5 Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French their primary trading partner and supplier of arms.
6 The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict.

3 When Johnson was seen as the larger threat Vaudreuil sent Dieskau to Fort St Frédéric to meet that threat.
4 Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River but Johnson had strongly fortified it and Dieskaus Indian support was reluctant to attack.

3 Moncktons forces including companies of Rogers Rangers forcibly removed thousands of Acadians chasing down many who resisted and sometimes committing atrocities.
4 More than any other factor the cutting off of supplies to Louisbourg led to its demise.
5 The Acadian resistance in concert with native allies including the Mikmaq was sometimes quite stiff with ongoing frontier raids against Dartmouth and Lunenburg among others.

2 In January they ambushed British rangers near Ticonderoga.
3 In February they launched a daring raid against the position across the frozen Lake George destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification.
4 In early August Montcalm and 7000 troops besieged the fort which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole.
5 When the withdrawal began some of Montcalms Indian allies angered at the lost opportunity for loot attacked the British column killing and capturing several hundred men women children and slaves.
6 The aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of smallpox into remote Indian populations as some Indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the Mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward having been exposed to European carriers.
7 What troops attacked Fort William Henry in early 1757?	French irregular forces Canadian scouts and Indians	1
8 On what lake did troops attack fort willima henry in winter?	Lake George	3

1 Vaudreuil and Montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758 as the British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping.
2 The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757 a difficult winter and the allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot the intendant of the territory.
3 His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates.
4 A massive outbreak of smallpox among western tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758.
5 While many parties to the conflict blamed others the Indians blamed the French for bringing bad medicine as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry the disease was probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle.
6 Montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St Lawrence with primary defenses at Carillon Quebec and Louisbourg while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years.
7 What was causing New France to have issues with resupplying?	British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping	1
8 What other reason caused poor supply of New France from a difficult winter?	poor harvest	2

1 The British failures in North America combined with other failures in the European theater led to the fall from power of Newcastle and his principal military advisor the Duke of Cumberland.
2 Newcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which Pitt dominated the military planning.
3 He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun.
4 He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757.
5 Pitts plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops supported by the provincial militias aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France.
6 Two of the expeditions were successful with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg falling to sizable British forces.

1 In the aftermath of generally poor French results in most theaters of the Seven Years War in 1758 Frances new foreign minister the duc de Choiseul decided to focus on an invasion of Britain to draw British resources away from North America and the European mainland.
2 The invasion failed both militarily and politically as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France and sent funds to Britains ally on the mainland Prussia and the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay.
3 In one piece of good fortune some French supply ships managed to depart France eluding the British blockade of the French coast.

1 The war in North America officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763 and war in the European theatre of the Seven Years War was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763.
2 The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique which had been occupied by the British.
3 France chose to cede the former but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon two small islands in the Gulf of St Lawrence along with fishing rights in the area.
4 They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent.
5 The contemporaneous French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow.
6 The British for their part were happy to take New France as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue and also because they already had ample places from which to obtain sugar.
7 Spain which traded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba also gained Louisiana including New Orleans from France in compensation for its losses.
8 Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations.

1 Britain gained control of French Canada and Acadia colonies containing approximately 80000 primarily Frenchspeaking Roman Catholic residents.
2 The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 resulted in land made available to migrants from Europe and the colonies further south.
3 The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces but many went to France and some went to New Orleans which they had expected to remain French.
4 Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands these latter efforts were unsuccessful.
5 Others migrated to places like SaintDomingue and fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution.
6 The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population.

1 Following the treaty King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7 1763 which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations.
2 Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population a demarcation that was at best a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westwardbound settlers.
3 The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians.
4 When accommodations were made in the Quebec Act in 1774 to address this and other issues religious concerns were raised in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of popery the Act maintained French Civil law including the seigneurial system a medieval code soon to be removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution.

1 For many native populations the elimination of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to British expansion leading to their ultimate dispossession.
2 The Ohio Country was particularly vulnerable to legal and illegal settlement due to the construction of military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes.
3 Although the Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory which was not completed until 1769 had modest repercussions the British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the British and a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek historic enemies whose divisions the British at times exploited.
4 The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave.
5 Most went to Cuba including the entire governmental records from St Augustine although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico.

1 Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force.
2 In part this was due to an incomplete understanding of the sometimes nonobvious force of friction and a consequently inadequate view of the nature of natural motion.
3 A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion even at a constant velocity.
4 Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton.
5 With his mathematical insight Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improvedon for nearly three hundred years.
6 By the early 20th century Einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia.

1 With modern insights into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light particle physics has devised a Standard Model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms.
2 The Standard Model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed.
3 Only four main interactions are known in order of decreasing strength they are strong electromagnetic weak and gravitational.
4 2–1079 Highenergy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction.

1 Aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of Aristotelian cosmology.
2 In Aristotles view the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different natural places therein.
3 Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth those composed mostly of the elements earth and water to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone.
4 He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their natural place eg for heavy bodies to fall which led to natural motion and unnatural or forced motion which required continued application of a force.
5 This theory based on the everyday experience of how objects move such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles such as the flight of arrows.
6 The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight and while the projectile sailed through the air no discernible efficient cause acts on it.
7 Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectiles path carries the projectile to its target.
8 This explanation demands a continuum like air for change of place in general.

10 What was the concept of force an integral part of?	Aristotelian cosmology	1

1 The shortcomings of Aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of Galileo Galilei who was influenced by the late Medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus.
2 Galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the Aristotelian theory of motion early in the 17th century.
3 He showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force for example friction.
4 When were the shortcomings of Aristotles physics overcome?	17th century	1
5 Whose work  corrected Aristotles physics in the seventeenth century?	Galileo Galilei	1

7 Who experimented by rolling stones and canonballs down a steep incline?	Galileo	2
8 What force acted on bodies to retard their velocity?	friction	3
1 Newtons First Law of Motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force or resultant force.
2 This law is an extension of Galileos insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force see a more detailed description of this below.
3 Newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium natural state in place of the Aristotelian idea of the natural state of rest.
4 That is the first law contradicts the intuitive Aristotelian belief that a net force is required to keep an object moving with constant velocity.
5 By making rest physically indistinguishable from nonzero constant velocity Newtons First Law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities.
6 Specifically in systems where objects are moving with different velocities it is impossible to determine which object is in motion and which object is at rest.
7 In other words to phrase matters more technically the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference that is in all frames related by a Galilean transformation.
8 Whose First Law of Motion says that unless acted upon be forces objects would continue to move at a constant velocity?	Newton	1
9 What insight of Galileo was associated with constant velocity?	lack of net force	2

12 What are the laws of physics of Galileo in reference to objest in motion and rest?	the same	7
1 For instance while traveling in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity the laws of physics do not change from being at rest.
2 A person can throw a ball straight up in the air and catch it as it falls down without worrying about applying a force in the direction the vehicle is moving.
3 This is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle.
4 It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicles motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down.
5 From the perspective of the person in the car the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction.
6 Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable.
7 Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.
8 What doesnt change from being at rest to movement at a constant velocity?	laws of physics	1
9 What path does a ball thrown up and down in a moving vehicle take when seen by an outside observer?	parabolic	3
10 What sate are things inside of a moving vehicle as seen by a  person inside the vehicle?	at rest	5
11 What applies to equally to constant velocity motion as it does to rest	Inertia 	7.
1 The concept of inertia can be further generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion even those that are not strictly constant velocity.
2 The rotational inertia of planet Earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year.
3 Albert Einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration such as those freefalling toward a gravitating object were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames.
4 This is why for example astronauts experience weightlessness when in freefall orbit around the Earth and why Newtons Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments.
5 If an astronaut places an object with mass in midair next to himself it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia.
6 This is the same thing that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space with no net force of gravity acting on their shared reference frame.
7 This principle of equivalence was one of the foundational underpinnings for the development of the general theory of relativity.
8 What concept explains why objects continue in constant motion?	inertia	1

1 Newtons Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass.
2 Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements.
3 However while kinematics are welldescribed through reference frame analysis in advanced physics there are still deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass.
4 General relativity offers an equivalence between spacetime and mass but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales.
5 With some justification Newtons second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.
6 What describes the proportionality of acceleration to force and mass?	Newtons Second Law	1

1 Newtons Third Law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects.
2 The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodiesNote 3 and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body.
3 Whenever a first body exerts a force F on a second body the second body exerts a force −F on the first body.
4 F and −F are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
5 This law is sometimes referred to as the actionreaction law with F called the action and −F the reaction.
6 The action and the reaction are simultaneous.
7 When forces are from the presence of differnet objects what law gives symmetry?	Newtons Third	1
8 What law staes that forces are interactions between bodies?	Newtons Third	1
9 What kind of force does not exist under Newtons third law?	unidirectional	2
10 What is the equality of forces between two objects exerting force on each other?	magnitude	4
1 This means that in a closed system of particles there are no internal forces that are unbalanced.
2 That is the actionreaction force shared between any two objects in a closed system will not cause the center of mass of the system to accelerate.
3 The constituent objects only accelerate with respect to each other the system itself remains unaccelerated.
4 Alternatively if an external force acts on the system then the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.

7 In what kind of system of particles are there no unbalanced iinternal forces?	closed	1
8 What is the magnitude of force divided by when external force is added?	mass of the system	4
1 Since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces.
2 As with other physical concepts eg.
3 temperature the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions that are consistent with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale.
4 Through experimentation it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.
5 What does pushing and pulling perceptions provide for describing forces?	intuitive understanding	1
6 What is used to quantify the intuitive undestanding of forces?	standard measurement scale	3
7 What offers a conceptual definition of force?	Newtonian mechanics	4
8 How are laboratory measurements of forces determined?	experimentation	4
1 Forces act in a particular direction and have sizes dependent upon how strong the push or pull is.
2 Because of these characteristics forces are classified as vector quantities.
3 This means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction denoted scalar quantities.
4 For example when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object it is necessary to know both the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the result.
5 If both of these pieces of information are not known for each force the situation is ambiguous.
6 For example if you know that two people are pulling on the same rope with known magnitudes of force but you do not know which direction either person is pulling it is impossible to determine what the acceleration of the rope will be.
7 The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction.
8 In this simple onedimensional example without knowing the direction of the forces it is impossible to decide whether the net force is the result of adding the two force magnitudes or subtracting one from the other.
9 Associating forces with vectors avoids such problems.
10 How are forces classified with regard to push and pull strengt?	vector quantities	2
11 What physical quantities do not have direction?	denoted scalar quantities	3
12 How do you avoid problems when determining forces involved on an object from two or more sources?	Associating forces with vectors	9
13 If you do not know both magnitude and direction of two forces on an object what would you call that situation?	ambiguous	5
14 How do you determine the acceleration of a rope when two people are pulling it?	Associating forces with vectors	9
1 Historically forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out.
2 Such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities they have magnitude and direction.
3 When two forces act on a point particle the resulting force the resultant also called the net force can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram.
4 The magnitude of the resultant varies from the difference of the magnitudes of the two forces to their sum depending on the angle between their lines of action.
5 However if the forces are acting on an extended body their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body.
6 In what conditions were forces first measured historically?	static equilibrium	1
7 What do forces have with regard to additive quantities?	magnitude and direction	2
8 What is the resultant force called when two forces act on a particle?	net force	3
9 When forces are acting on an extended body what do you need to account for motion effects?	respective lines of application	5
10 What geometric shape is used in equations to determine net force?	parallelogram	3
1 As well as being added forces can also be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other.
2 A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces one pointing north and one pointing east.
3 Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force.
4 Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions.
5 This is because for orthogonal components the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors.
6 Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other.
7 Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient.
8 Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable since that force would then have only one nonzero component.
9 Orthogonal force vectors can be threedimensional with the third component being at rightangles to the other two.
10 Whwn forces are at right ngles to each other what can they be broken down to?	independent components	1
11 If a force is pointing horizontally to the northeast how many forces can you split the force into?	two	2
12 What do you get when you figure the sum of forces with vector addition?	the original force	3
13 What are the independant components of a vector sum that has been determined by scalar addition of individual vectors?	orthogonal	5
14 What can orthogonal forces be when there are three components with two at right angles to each other?	threedimensional	9
1 Pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction generated between the object and the table surface.
2 For a situation with no movement the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration.
3 The static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object.
4 What can keep an object from moving when it is being pushed on a surface?	static friction	1
5 What is generated between a surface and an object that is being pushed?	static friction	1
6 Static friction balances what force when there is no movement of an object on a surface?	applied	2
7 What makes static friction go up or down in responce to contact characteristics between an object and the surface it is on?	applied force	3
1 A static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances.
2 For example an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the spring reaction force which equals the objects weight.
3 Using such tools some quantitative force laws were discovered that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights Archimedes principle for buoyancy Archimedes analysis of the lever Boyles law for gas pressure and Hookes law for springs.
4 These were all formulated and experimentally verified before Isaac Newton expounded his Three Laws of Motion.
5 What can scales and spring balances measure between two forces by using static equilibrium?	forces	1
6 What force acts on an object suspended on a spring scale in addition to gravity?	spring reaction force	2
7 What equals the spring reaction force on an object suspended on a spring reaction scale?	gravity	2
8 Objects of constant density are proportional to volume by what force to define standard weights?	gravity	3
9 Who expounded the Three Laws of Motion?	Isaac Newton	4
1 Dynamic equilibrium was first described by Galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic.
2 Galileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that the concept of an absolute rest frame did not exist.
3 Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest.
4 This was contrary to Aristotles notion of a natural state of rest that objects with mass naturally approached.
5 Simple experiments showed that Galileos understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct.
6 For example if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crows nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it.
7 Thus in an Aristotelian universe the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship.
8 However when this experiment is actually conducted the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it.
9 Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls.
10 Thus no force is required to keep the cannonball moving at the constant forward velocity.
11 Who first described dynamic equilibrium?	Galileo	1
12 What does motion at a constant velocity equal?	rest	3
13 Who had the idea of a natural state for objects at rest?	Galileo	3
14 Where will a canonball dropped from the crows nest of a ship land according to Aristotle?	behind the foot of the mast	7
15 Where does a canonball dropped from the crows nest of a ship actually land?	foot of the mast	8
1 A simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction.
2 In such a situation a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force.
3 This results in zero net force but since the object started with a nonzero velocity it continues to move with a nonzero velocity.
4 Aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force.
5 However when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion.

1 The notion force keeps its meaning in quantum mechanics though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the Schrödinger equation instead of Newtonian equations.
2 This has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes quantized ie.
3 they appear in discrete portions.
4 This is of course difficult to imagine in the context of forces.
5 However the potentials Vxyz or fields from which the forces generally can be derived are treated similar to classical position variables ie .
6 What equation currently decribes the physics of force	Schrödinger 	1.
7 What equation desribed the physics of force before the current Schrodinger equation?	Newtonian	1

10 What notion keeps its meaning through both Netonian and Schrodinger physics equations?	force	1
1 However already in quantum mechanics there is one caveat namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable but also a discrete intrinsic angular momentumlike variable called the spin and there is the Pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables.
2 Depending on the value of the spin identical particles split into two different classes fermions and bosons.
3 If two identical fermions eg.
4 electrons have a symmetric spin function eg.
5 parallel spins the spatial variables must be antisymmetric ie.
6 they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force and vice versa ie.
7 for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric ie.
8 the apparent force must be attractive.
9 Thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables whereas for two bosons eg.
10 quanta of electromagnetic waves photons the correlation is strictly positive.
11 What is the intrisic angular variable called when particles act upon one another?	spin	1
12 What is the principle about relating spin and space variables?	Pauli	1

15 If the apparant force of two fermions is repulsive what is the spin function?	parallel	5
1 In modern particle physics forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical byproduct of exchange of momentumcarrying gauge bosons.
2 With the development of quantum field theory and general relativity it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum 4momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics.
3 The conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force.
4 Thus the currently known fundamental forces are considered more accurately to be fundamental interactions.
5 199–128 When particle A emits creates or absorbs annihilates virtual particle B a momentum conservation results in recoil of particle A making impression of repulsion or attraction between particles A A exchanging by B.
6 This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions.
7 While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict in full detail the accurate result of such interactions there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams.
8 In a Feynman diagram each matter particle is represented as a straight line see world line traveling through time which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram.
9 Matter and antimatter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram.
10 World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines.
11 Gauge bosons are emitted away from the vertex as wavy lines and in the case of virtual particle exchange are absorbed at an adjacent vertex.

1 All of the forces in the universe are based on four fundamental interactions.
2 The strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances and are responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles including nucleons and compound nuclei.
3 The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges and the gravitational force acts between masses.
4 All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions.
5 For example friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces and the Pauli exclusion principle which does not permit atoms to pass through each other.
6 Similarly the forces in springs modeled by Hookes law are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position.
7 Centrifugal forces are acceleration forces that arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.

1 The development of fundamental theories for forces proceeded along the lines of unification of disparate ideas.
2 For example Isaac Newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation.
3 Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism.
4 In the 20th century the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces all except gravity are manifestations of matter fermions interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons.
5 This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation.
6 The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete.
7 A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics.
8 Physicists are still attempting to develop selfconsistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything.
9 Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.

1 What we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work of Isaac Newton.
2 Before Newton the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects.
3 Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in freefall was constant and independent of the mass of the object.
4 Today this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as  and has a magnitude of about 981 meters per second squared this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location and points toward the center of the Earth.
5 This observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the Earths surface is directly proportional to the objects mass.
6 Thus an object that has a mass of  will experience a force.
7 Who identified gravity as a force?	Isaac Newton	1
8 Who came up with the concept that falling objects fell at the same speed regardless of weight?	Galileo	3
9 How fast do objects fall on Earth?	about 981 meters per second squared	4

11 What is an objects mass proportional to at the surface of the Earth?	force of gravity	5
1 Newton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances.
2 In particular Newton determined that the acceleration of the Moon around the Earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law.
3 Further Newton realized that the acceleration due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the attracting body.
4 Combining these ideas gives a formula that relates the mass  and the radius  of the Earth to the gravitational acceleration.
5 How might gravity effects be observed differently according to Newton?	at larger distances	1

1 In this equation a dimensional constant  is used to describe the relative strength of gravity.
2 This constant has come to be known as Newtons Universal Gravitation Constant though its value was unknown in Newtons lifetime.
3 Not until 1798 was Henry Cavendish able to make the first measurement of  using a torsion balance this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the Earth since knowing  could allow one to solve for the Earths mass given the above equation.
4 Newton however realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same laws of motion his law of gravity had to be universal.
5 Succinctly stated Newtons Law of Gravitation states that the force on a spherical object of mass  due to the gravitational pull of mass  is.

1 It was only the orbit of the planet Mercury that Newtons Law of Gravitation seemed not to fully explain.
2 Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet Vulcan that would explain the discrepancies however despite some early indications no such planet could be found.
3 When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity GR he turned his attention to the problem of Mercurys orbit and found that his theory added a correction which could account for the discrepancy.
4 This was the first time that Newtons Theory of Gravity had been shown to be less correct than an alternative.

6 What planet did astrophysisist predict to explain the problems with Mercury?	Vulcan	2
7 What theory accounted for the Mercury problem?	theory of general relativity	3
8 Who came up with the theory of relativity?	Albert Einstein	3
9 Who first showed that Newtons Theory of Gravity was not as correct as another theory?	Albert Einstein	3
1 Since then and so far general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity.
2 In GR gravitation is not viewed as a force but rather objects moving freely in gravitational fields travel under their own inertia in straight lines through curved spacetime – defined as the shortest spacetime path between two spacetime events.
3 From the perspective of the object all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever.
4 It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of spacetime can be observed and the force is inferred from the objects curved path.
5 Thus the straight line path in spacetime is seen as a curved line in space and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object.
6 For example a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola as it is in a uniform gravitational field.
7 Its spacetime trajectory when the extra ct dimension is added is almost a straight line slightly curved with the radius of curvature of the order of few lightyears.
8 The time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as gravitational force.

1 The origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when James Clerk Maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by Oliver Heaviside and Josiah Willard Gibbs.
2 These Maxwell Equations fully described the sources of the fields as being stationary and moving charges and the interactions of the fields themselves.
3 This led Maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be selfgenerating through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light.
4 This insight united the nascent fields of electromagnetic theory with optics and led directly to a complete description of the electromagnetic spectrum.

1 However attempting to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations the photoelectric effect and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe proved troublesome.
2 Through the work of leading theoretical physicists a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics.
3 This final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics or QED which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave–particles known as photons.

1 It is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter to the repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force.
2 However these characteristics actually result from the Pauli exclusion principle.
3 citation needed Since electrons are fermions they cannot occupy the same quantum mechanical state as other electrons.
4 When the electrons in a material are densely packed together there are not enough lower energy quantum mechanical states for them all so some of them must be in higher energy states.
5 This means that it takes energy to pack them together.
6 While this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states.

1 The strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles.
2 However a residual of the force is observed between hadrons the best known example being the force that acts between nucleons in atomic nuclei as the nuclear force.
3 Here the strong force acts indirectly transmitted as gluons which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons which classically transmit the nuclear force see this topic for more.

1 The weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy W and Z bosons.
2 Its most familiar effect is beta decay of neutrons in atomic nuclei and the associated radioactivity.
3 The word weak derives from the fact that the field strength is some 1013 times less than that of the strong force.
4 Still it is stronger than gravity over short distances.
5 A consistent electroweak theory has also been developed which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins.

1 The normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact.
2 When their electron clouds overlap Pauli repulsion due to fermionic nature of electrons follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects.
3 93 The normal force for example is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object.

1 Tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless frictionless unbreakable and unstretchable.
2 They can be combined with ideal pulleys which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction.
3 Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in actionreaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object.
4 By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a setup that uses movable pulleys the tension force on a load can be multiplied.
5 For every string that acts on a load another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load.
6 However even though such machines allow for an increase in force there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load.
7 These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.

1 Newtons laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than threedimensional objects.
2 However in real life matter has extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object.
3 For situations where lattice holding together the atoms in an object is able to flow contract expand or otherwise change shape the theories of continuum mechanics describe the way forces affect the material.

1 Torque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that angle is the rotational equivalent for position angular velocity for velocity and angular momentum for momentum.
2 As a consequence of Newtons First Law of Motion there exists rotational inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque.
3 Likewise Newtons Second Law of Motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous angular acceleration of the rigid body.
4 What is the force equivalent of torque compared to angular momentum?	rotational equivalent for position	1
5 What would change the rotational inertia of a body under Newtons First Law of Motion?	unbalanced torque	2
6 To calculate instant angular acceleration of a rigid body what would you use?	Newtons Second Law of Motion	3
1 where  is the mass of the object  is the velocity of the object and  is the distance to the center of the circular path and  is the unit vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center.
2 This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path.
3 Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object and therefore do not change the speed of the object magnitude of the velocity but only the direction of the velocity vector.
4 The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path and one that is tangential to the path.
5 This yields both the tangential force which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up and the radial centripetal force which changes its direction.

10 What is resposible for speeding up or slowing down an object?	tangential force	5
1 A conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms.
2 This means that for a closed system the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system.
3 The force therefore is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.

8 What is the force called rgarding a potential field between two locations?	artifact	3
1 For certain physical scenarios it is impossible to model forces as being due to gradient of potentials.
2 This is often due to macrophysical considerations that yield forces as arising from a macroscopic statistical average of microstates.
3 For example friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector.
4 Nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces tension compression and drag.
5 However for any sufficiently detailed description all these forces are the results of conservative ones since each of these macroscopic forces are the net results of the gradients of microscopic potentials.

9 Tension compression and drag are what kind of forces?	Nonconservative	4
1 The connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics.
2 In macroscopic closed systems nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system and are often associated with the transfer of heat.
3 According to the Second law of thermodynamics nonconservative forces necessarily result in energy transformations within closed systems from ordered to more random conditions as entropy increases.
